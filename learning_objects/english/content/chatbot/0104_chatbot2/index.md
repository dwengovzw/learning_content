# Types of chatbots

## Software systems
Chatbots are software systems that can interact with people via typed text messages. This happens through spontaneous text in natural language. A chatbot
is therefore nothing more than a robot you can chat with, an automated digital system with which you can engage in dialogue.

Chatbots are used for various purposes, for example:<br>
- chatbots that answer frequently asked questions, essentially a virtual helpdesk;
- chatbots that handle complaints;
- chatbots that can tackle more difficult problems, such as the virtual therapist Woebot (Health, 2021).

### Examples
- To save time, here and there the anamnesis interview at the doctor's is replaced by a chatbot conversation, for example with Bingli; the useful information is passed on to the doctor (Bingli, 2021).
- Millions of people chat via WeChat or another online platform with their virtual girlfriend Xiaoice, sometimes out of loneliness (Davies, 2021).
- The possibilities of deploying chatbots for education are also being explored, for example for foreign language classes (Dokukina & Gumanova, 2020).
- Researchers are also investigating how chatbots can be used for scientific research, e.g., by having chatbots conduct interviews and by using chatbots to inform people about the impact that participation in a study may have (Kenniscentrum Data & Maatschappij, 2020c,a).
- ChatGPT.


## From rule-based to deep learning
The simplest chatbots, including the first chatbots such as ELIZA, are **knowledge-based** systems. In such chatbots, various scenarios are explicitly programmed. This automatically leads to limitations that require users to adapt to the limits of the system. For example, if someone phrases a question to the chatbot differently than programmed, the chatbot will not recognize the question.<br>
Such chatbots are often not popular, but are still used on many websites.

> Do you want to know more about knowledge- and data-based systems? See the learning path ['Artificial intelligence'].(https://www.dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=un_artificiele_intelligentie&language=nl&te=true&source_page=%2Fchatbot%2F&source_title=%20Chatbot#un_ai;nl;3)  

Modern chatbots make use of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, i.e., machine learning; in particular, with deep learning a chatbot can recognize questions with similar content.

*In the notebook in the previous menu item, you worked with such a knowledge-based chatbot yourself. This was improved by applying a machine learning technique to it.*

> A recent, but already very well-known example is ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a user-friendly chatbot that you can ask anything, such as translating, summarizing or rephrasing texts, creating rubrics, and making little poems. <br>Later in this learning path you will learn more about ChatGPT.
