# Learning chatbots

Learning chatbots, such as ChatGPT, are based on large language models. 

Although learning chatbots like ChatGPT often write very nice sentences, they unfortunately also tend to make up quite a lot of nonsense. 

You could chat with ChatGPT as a class. The students can come up with questions, and the answers can be discussed as a class. 

Possible guiding questions:<br>
* Can the chatbot do math?
* Can you catch the chatbot giving wrong/bizarre answers?
* Ask follow-up questions about a topic you yourself know a lot about.

The students are also presented with a *fake* news article. You can discuss this with them.<br>
Afterwards they can come up with a question for ChatGPT to have it write a *fake* message.

Finally, they see what ChatGPT can do for them by means of a few exercises.
