# Conclusion and a fun closing note

* Learning chatbots often make things up.
* Learning chatbots are flexible and fluent.
* Rule-based chatbots don't do that, but they also don't always give correct answers. If the question isn't 'preprogrammed', they sometimes give an answer that actually belongs to a different question. Or sometimes they reply that they can't help you, which is also annoying. So they are not flexible. You can read more about this in [chapter 4 of the manual](https://dwengo.org/assets/files/chatbot/Chatbot_handleiding_eerstedruk.pdf) for the chatbot project. 

Maybe a fun closing note:
