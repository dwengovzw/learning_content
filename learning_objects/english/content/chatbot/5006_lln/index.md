# How does a learning chatbot work?

A chatbot based on a learning AI system has learned by reading a lot of texts. For example, the texts of Wikipedia, posts on social media, and entire books that are online.<br>  
In those texts, some words often appear together. In a text about a dog or a cat, for example, it will often also be about a veterinarian. In a text about a school, it will often be about teachers and students, and about lunch boxes, school bags, textbooks, laptops, and sometimes also about the school bell.

The AI system remembers all that information by structuring it in a certain way. Simply put:<br>
* You can think of it as a large field in which words are placed.
* Words that have a lot to do with each other are close together.
* Words that have nothing to do with each other are far apart.
* In that field you can also find relationships, such as 'king-queen' and 'man-woman'.
* The position of 'queen' relative to 'king', and the position of 'woman' relative to 'man' looks the same in the field.

**By doing the following exercises you will better understand how a learning chatbot works and why it sometimes says incorrect things.** 

### Assignment 1

Look at the first diagram. Read the text that ChatGPT wrote that belongs with the first diagram.

### Assignment 3

Read the words in the field.

Place the cards in the field. The more closely words belong together, the closer you place them to each other. There are multiple correct answers. Maybe you came up with a unique solution to this problem!
