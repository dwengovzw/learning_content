# Assignments for the classroom

**Discussion**<br>
Can a chatbot replace the teacher?

**Chat with ELIZA yourself**<br>
Chat with [ELIZA](https://web.njit.edu/~ronkowit/eliza.html) yourself.<br>
Or chat [in Dutch](https://www.eclecticenergies.com/nederlands/psyche/eliza).<br>
Can ELIZA be convincing as a psychotherapist?

**Chat with ALICE**<br>
ALICE from 1995 is the first online chatbot.<br>
Chat with [ALICE](https://www.pandorabots.com/pandora/talk?botid=b8d616e35e36e881) yourself.

**Discussion**<br>
To save time, the anamnesis interview at the doctor’s could be replaced by a chatbot conversation, with the useful information forwarded to the doctor.

**Chat with the chatbot of the Data & Society Knowledge Centre**<br>
Chat with this [chatbot](https://data-en-maatschappij.ai/nieuws/de-chatbot-van-het-kenniscentrum-data-maatschappij) yourself.<br>
Is this chatbot a knowledge-based or data-based system?

**Throw a chatbot off track**<br>
There are many chatbots to be found on the web. Pick one and try to throw that chatbot off track.

**Discussion brAInfood chatbots**<br>
The Data & Society Knowledge Centre published a [‘brAInfood’](https://dwengo.org/assets/files/chatbot/Brainfood13_Chatbots_NL.pdf) to encourage young people to handle chatbots more consciously.

**Generating a magazine article with GPT-2**<br>
Read the article ‘Will robots replace the journalist’s job?’ in the [manual](https://dwengo.org/assets/files/chatbot/Chatbot_handleiding_eerstedruk.pdf) of the Chatbot project on p. 43.<br>

**Bias**<br>
Ask questions and give tasks to ChatGPT and try to catch it amplifying prejudices present in our society.

**Hallucinating**<br>
ChatGPT makes up answers. It continually completes a given sequence of words with the word that is most likely to follow.<br>
Ask ChatGPT a question about something you know well yourself. Can you get ChatGPT to hallucinate?

**Preparing a class discussion**<br>
Choose a proposition from the [card set](https://dwengo.org/assets/files/care/Kaartset_AIIndeZorg_AIOpSchool_Dwengo.pdf) of the ‘AI in Healthcare’ project. <br>
Example:<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48352335/218336427-bc8cfc21-bb17-4da7-9816-116f70d0a507.png)

Some students each formulate for themselves whether they agree with the proposition and why. Afterwards, the students (individually) ask ChatGPT what the pros and cons are of being washed by a robot. Each student reflects on the aspects that ChatGPT has raised. The student devises arguments and examples to confirm or refute what ChatGPT brings up. Afterwards, a discussion follows in class within this group of students in which they try to convince each other of their own position. Because ChatGPT has already confronted them with elements they may not have thought of themselves, they are better prepared for this discussion.
