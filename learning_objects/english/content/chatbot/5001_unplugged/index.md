# What is a chatbot?

*You start this lesson with a simple definition.*<br>
*Next, you address the fact that not all chatbots work equally well. They also don't all work in the same way.*

## Types of chatbots

There are rule-based chatbots and there are learning chatbots. *The [Chatbot learning path](https://dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=cb1_chatbot&language=nl&te=true&source_page=%2Fchatbot%2F&source_title=%20Chatbot#cb_chatbot_inleiding;nl;3) goes into this in more depth. The 'hallucination' of a chatbot like ChatGPT is also covered there.*

## Assignment

*Can students explain why they can confuse Billy?*

Billy, the chatbot from bol.com, is a rule-based chatbot. You can find him at the bottom left of this [web page](https://www.bol.com/nl/nl/m/klantenservice/).

Have a chat with Billy. Can you confuse him?

*Tips you can give students for the chat conversation:*<br>
* Start the conversation by asking a question. What do you see? 
* Try to get information about a product. 
* Ask what time your dentist appointment is. What do you see? 
* What does Billie, the chatbot, do when he cannot answer? 

Have the students conduct a conversation with different chatbots. <br>
Think of Zalando, the Data & Society knowledge center … or chat with the very first chatbot [ELIZA](https://www.eclecticenergies.com/nederlands/psyche/eliza). <br>
Perhaps your students know other chatbots ... and maybe they use one such as Snapchat's MyAI chatbot. 

*Debrief:*<br>
* How did you experience chatting with the chatbot? 
* What does this chatbot do when it doesn't know the answer? 
* What would be the advantages of this chatbot? 
* What would be the disadvantages of this chatbot? 
* What similarities/differences do you notice between the different chatbots? 

*By chatting with ELIZA you can discuss with your students the use of a chatbot as a therapist.*<br> 
* *Do they think that's a good idea or not?*
* *You can, for example, point out that chatbots are being made for therapy, e.g., [Woebot]([https://woebothealth.com/](https://woebothealth.com/faq/) (with a special version for young people).*

*Some people also have a virtual friend in the form of an app on their smartphone, such as the chatbots Replika and Xiaoice.*
* *Do the students think that's a fun idea?*
* *When could that be valuable?*
* *What dangers are lurking around the corner?*

*A 2020 study by Følstad & Brandtzaeg shows that a chatbot conversation can also be about small talk, or about someone's feelings and life. Some users take on the challenge of testing the chatbot: to what extent is the chatbot able to respond like a human. But for others, the chatbot is a way to get through the day; although they are aware that they are conversing with a machine, the chat is considered a valuable social interaction.*<br>
*If people only 'hang out' with virtual 'app' friends, they can end up in a 'bubble': for example, they don't get feedback on their behavior: the apps are generally accommodating and will not 'put the user in their place', as real friends sometimes do.*
