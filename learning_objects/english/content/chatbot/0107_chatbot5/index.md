# ChatGPT and co

## Accessible
The user interface of ChatGPT looks simple and is of the same nature as chatting in an app like WhatsApp or Signal. The user-friendliness of ChatGPT has ensured that the system reached the general public. <br>
However, the technology is not brand-new. ChatGPT originated from GPT-3.5, a successor to GPT-3. GPT-3 has been around for 2 years, and numerous applications to e.g. generate poems and blogs (with GPT-3) have been on the web for quite some time. Through ChatGPT the general public discovered the opportunities of these AI systems that have actually been in use for quite some time, and concerns surfaced at the same time.

## Citizen science
In fact, OpenAI is currently conducting a massive citizen science project with ChatGPT. The system has been tested on an unprecedented scale starting from week one of the launch in November 2022. There was talk of 1 million users after the first week and 100 million in January 2023. The developers at OpenAI use user input to improve the system. At the launch of ChatGPT, OpenAI set an age limit of 18 years, but this was not respected. In the meantime, the age limit has been adjusted to 13 years (with parental or guardian consent). Some are therefore *worried about the use of the chatbot by minors*.

## Similar chatbots
ChatGPT is not the only one of its kind. Another chatbot is [ChatSonic](https://writesonic.com/chat), where you can also ask it to generate images. Google has [Bard](https://bard.google.com/), a sibling of ChatGPT. Bard does have up-to-date information because Bard can consult the World Wide Web.
Experiments are also being conducted with the chatbot [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/index/introducing-claude). It was developed by former OpenAI employees. And undoubtedly there are and will be more.

## ChatGPT 
To arrive at ChatGPT, OpenAI first fine-tuned the large language model GPT-3 into InstructGPT (or **GPT-3.5**). This was to better meet user expectations and human values, and to make the output more truthful. <br>
To do this they used a technique called ***reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)***, reinforcement learning via human feedback.
Finally, a GPT-3.5 model whose training was finalized in early 2022 was further improved to arrive at ChatGPT.

**How did all this work?**
- The original dataset was mixed with conversations created by humans, albeit inspired by answers generated by the AI model. This dataset was then transformed into a *dialogue format*. People indicated whether the generated answers were adequate and made suggestions to improve them. 
- Then people ranked multiple generated answers to the same prompt from poor to good quality. 
- With these data a model was created that can indicate with a *score* how good a particular answer to a prompt is. That model assigns a score to a generated answer. 
- Then that scoring model is used to improve the generation of answers to prompts. Through *reinforcement learning*, ChatGPT was trained to give ‘the most human’ answer to prompts. The model was rewarded for a good answer and penalized for a bad answer.
- In addition, OpenAI has done a lot to prevent ChatGPT from generating racist or sexist texts, or texts that incite hatred. For this, however, shadow workers were used, in this case underpaid Kenyans who were traumatized by what they had to read. (Source: https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/)

ChatGPT is less powerful than GPT-3, because GPT-3 can also do other things besides generating text based on a prompt, e.g., perform a classification based on an image.

ChatGPT does not (as yet) have access to the World Wide Web and therefore does not have the latest information. OpenAI warns that ChatGPT's answers are not reliable and must always be approached critically.

ChatGPT generates text. ChatGPT also makes things up. This is called **hallucinating**.

> **Example: ChatGPT plays chess against the chess engine Stockfish.**<br>
> After each move by ChatGPT, the new board state is passed to the chess engine, which then calculates the next move each time starting from the pieces on the board.<br>
>![Chess game](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48352335/222217014-26aa20df-f29a-485c-a4b2-a4ef4259ab39.gif)<br>
> You can read the dialogue between ChatGPT and the chess engine [here](https://pastebin.com/X6kBRTa9).
> This shows that ChatGPT cannot play chess; logically, because it is a language model. For instance, it makes impossible moves and adds pieces. Chess theory is widely available on the World Wide Web, which is why with the first moves ChatGPT gives the impression that it can play chess, but it soon goes off the rails.
