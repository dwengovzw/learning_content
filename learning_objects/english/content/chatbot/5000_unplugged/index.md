# Chatbot unplugged

In this series of lessons, you give students insight into how a chatbot works. <br>
* They first receive an introduction to the field of artificial intelligence. There is room for a class discussion and for expressing their own views.  
* Next, through a role-play, they learn how a rule-based chatbot works (hence the name 'Chatbot unplugged'). 
* Depending on the student group and the time you have, you can go deeper into the technical side: how does a simple calculation determine which answer the chatbot gives when the question is not in its 'dictionary'?<br>
The chatbot looks for the most similar answer by calculating the 'distance' between the question asked and all the questions that are in its dictionary.
* Learning chatbots also use the concept of 'distance', albeit in a completely different way. The students explore how ChatGPT works with this.

**Although students do occasionally use a computer in this learning path, the title 'Chatbot unplugged' was still chosen. The students simulate the operation of a rule-based chatbot through a role-play, and the operation of a learning chatbot is also explained without a computer. There is no programming in this learning path.** 

**Click on the left, above the menu, on 'Link to learning path for students' to get the direct link to the student learning path. It is built with the white menu blocks. You can give that URL to your students so they can go directly to the student learning path.**

# The introduction 'What is AI?' is structured as follows:

## Class discussion

*Students often have no idea how many AI systems are already used in everyday life.*  

* Do you think you have already used artificial intelligence?
* Do you know any applications of artificial intelligence?

## From the newspaper

*We provide two headlines as examples. If you prefer to respond to current events or you don't find these articles suitable for your class group, be sure to choose others.*

Look at the two headlines:<br>
[AI chatbot convinced young Belgian to take his own life](https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20230328_99679587)<br>
[Pope in a white rapper jacket](https://www.hln.be/het-leukste-van-het-web/paus-in-opvallende-witte-rapperjas-gaat-viraal-maar-is-de-foto-wel-echt~aa454b78/)<br>
* What do these headlines evoke for you? 
* Do you find this exciting? Or does it make you a bit afraid?

## Assignment

*We collected some AI applications that students may already know. In our other AI projects, e.g. in the teacher guides, you can find a whole range of other, also less well-known, examples.*

See: [examples of artificial intelligence](https://dwengo.org/backend/api/learningObject/getWrapped?hruid=org-dwengo-jommeke-voorbeelden-ai-systemen&version=1&language=nl).

* Which of the AI applications shown appeal to you?
* Revisit this question: Have you already used artificial intelligence?

## Statements game

You can go a step further and have students take a position on certain statements.<br>
Examples of statements:<br>
* AI cannot be creative the way humans are.
* AI will replace most jobs and make people unemployed.
* AI can be used to solve social problems such as poverty.
* AI can be used to develop better medicines and cure diseases.

For this you can also use the [card set](https://dwengo.org/assets/files/care/Kaartset_AIIndeZorg_AIOpSchool_Dwengo.pdf) (with [guide](https://dwengo.org/assets/files/care/AIIndeZorgKaartenset_UitlegVoorLeerkracht.pdf)) from the AI in Healthcare project.
