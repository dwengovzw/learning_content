# Learning chatbots

Learning chatbots, such as ChatGPT, are based on large language models. 

## Nonsense

And even though learning chatbots like ChatGPT often write very nice sentences, unfortunately they also tend to make up quite a lot of nonsense. <br>
If, for example, you ask ChatGPT about something you know a lot about yourself, you might be able to catch it!<br>

## News articles and fake news

AI systems also make it possible to easily write news articles. On some news sites, for example, the short pieces with sports results are written by AI systems.<br>
Read the article below; would you notice that this was not written by a human?

You surely noticed that the content of this article is not true at all. Such articles are often not based on real facts. <br>
So people with less good intentions can use such chatbots, for example, to write *fake news*. And because chatbots like ChatGPT can write a lot of text in no time, they can do that more easily now than before.

### Assignment 1

**Come up with your own question for ChatGPT (or another chatbot) to make it write a fake message.**

## Using a learning chatbot

### Assignment 2

Suppose you run your own shoe store. <br>
Ask the chatbot to help you write an email to your accountant.

### Assignment 3

Give a complicated text to the chatbot and ask it to rewrite the text in simple language.

### Assignment 4

Give a story to the chatbot and ask it to rewrite that story for an 8-year-old child.
