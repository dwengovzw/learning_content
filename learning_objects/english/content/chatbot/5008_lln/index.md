# Extra activity: Turing test
(from the Improbotics lesson folder)

What is the Turing test?<br>
In 1950, the British mathematician Alan Turing wondered whether a machine could, in a conversation,
succeed in making a person believe that it is a human. In the Turing test, a human asks questions of an unknown party in
another room, which could be either a human or a machine, and then decides whether that party is human or not. A
machine that is regarded as human passes the Turing test. With this, Turing gave an initial impetus to the
research field we now know as artificial intelligence (AI).
Essentially, this is an experiment to see whether a machine can exhibit human-like intelligent behavior, which does not
mean that the machine would be as intelligent as a human.

#### Assignment: Organize a Turing test in groups of three, or as a demo for the class.
One student is the test subject who will chat with other students via two chat windows. You can use your
preferred chat system for this; ELIZA is one of the options.<br>
One of the chatters may type whatever he or she wants, but the task, as with ELIZA, is to be a listening ear
for the test subject and to write in correct Dutch complete sentences.<br>
The second chatter copies the test subject’s sentence to ELIZA each time and copies ELIZA’s reply back
into the chat window. Work, e.g., with CTRL-A (select all), CTRL-C (copy), and CTRL-V (paste) to be able to work as quickly
as the other chatter who is typing manually.<br>
The test subject does not know in advance which of the two is being controlled by the computer, but does try
to unmask that one. If the computer is not unmasked, then it passes the Turing test.

You can find a version of ELIZA in Dutch [here](https://www.eclecticenergies.com/nederlands/psyche/eliza).
