# Play chatbot yourself


You play a role-play to learn how rule-based chatbots work.

You play this role-play in pairs: you and a fellow student. One of you plays the chatbot, the other student plays the user (the person who uses the chatbot).

The user receives a script to set up a conversation with the chatbot. 

The chatbot receives a card set with on one side a possible question and on the other side the answer that the chatbot must give. 

The user builds a conversation. You are helped in this by the script.<br> 
The role-play proceeds as follows:<br>
* The user addresses the chatbot. That can be a greeting, a question, or an answer to a question the chatbot asked.
* The chatbot will look up this message in its 'dictionary', i.e., in the card set. Once it has found the right card, the chatbot knows what to say.
*  Then it's the user's turn again.
*  Etc.

The user is fairly free! You do not have to follow the script literally.<br>
The chatbot is not free at all. It must say exactly what the card instructs.
