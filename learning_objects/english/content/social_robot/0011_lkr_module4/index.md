# Lesson plan
## Module 4: Creative assignment and class discussion (Â± 2 hours)

*The link below takes you to module 4 of 'Social Robot'* <br>
[Module 4: Creative processing and debriefing](https://www.dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=sr4&language=en&te=true "Module 4")  

**Lesson Phase A - Creative assignments**
* Have the students present their creative assignments. If necessary, give them some time to prepare in class.


**Lesson Phase B - Class discussion to conclude project**
* Conclude the project with a class discussion on social robots.

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
Make sure the students have a reminder of their robot: a video, a photo... as they will have to dismantle the robot.<br>
However, the robot body can be kept. The openings that have been created by removing sensors and actuators can be filled with a printed or cardboard version. This way, the robot will still look like a robot.
