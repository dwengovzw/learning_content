# Lesson Plan
## Module 1: Introduction and unplugged computational thinking (Â± 2 class hours)

*The link below will take you to the student module*<br>
[Module 1: What are social robots?](https://www.dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=sr1&language=en "Module 1")

**Lesson Phase A - What are social robots?**

*Option 1*
* Start the lesson with a presentation of photos of social robots that already exist in society, such as Pepper, Paro, Aibo, or Hatchimal. You can then analyze these robots further to discuss the sensors and actuators and make the link to 'input-processing-output.'

*Option 2*
* Have the students draw a sketch of the robot of their dreams. Afterwards, discuss in class if there are any social robots among them. Finally, discuss some social robots that already exist in society.


**Lesson Phase B - Unplugged computational thinking**
* After the introduction, provide a short break to set up the active work forms.
* Activity 1: Make-a-face (whole class)
* Activity 2: Emotion machine (groups of 3 to 4)
* Make sure you have enough time left to clean up and go through the last lesson phase.


**Lesson Phase C - Exploring electronics**
* End the lesson by exploring the sensors and actuators in the kit of the 'Social Robot' project. The students must limit themselves to a selection of the parts in the kit and reusable materials for building the physical body of their own social robot.


**Lesson Phase D - Conclusion**
* Form the groups in which the students will build their social robots.
* Give them homework to (together) think about their social robot in preparation for the brainstorming that you will start with in the next lesson.
* Extra: The students can be given an assignment as preparation for the next lesson. For example, to search the world wide web for a social robot in a context that strongly appeals to them and create a digital document about it.
