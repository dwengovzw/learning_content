# Lesson Plan
## Module 2: Brainstorm, programming, and material selection (Â± 3 lesson hours)

*The following link will take you to the student module* <br>
[Module 2: Brainstorm and Programming](https://www.dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=sr2&language=en "Module 2")

*This module has a separate student module to keep a complete overview. The link below will take you to the exercises module* <br>
[Module 2: Exercises](https://www.dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=sr2_oefeningen&language=en "Module 2: Exercises")

**Lesson Phase A - Introduction**
* Provide sufficient structure and guidance to ensure that students do not lose themselves in their ideas. Brainstorming with students is not easy.
* Give the students the task for the brainstorming. Formulate what they should brainstorm about and what the outcome of the brainstorming should be.
* If there are limitations or criteria they need to consider, be sure to communicate them now.
* *Extra*: Explain brainstorming techniques.

**Lesson Phase B - Brainstorming**
* Preferably, let the students work in pairs or threes for the 'Social Robot' project. In the brainstorming session, they discuss what their robot should be able to do, how it should communicate, and what it should react to.
* After the brainstorming session, they must present a final design. This could be in the form of a mind map or a description. They must take into account the imposed criteria, the limitations of the kit, their own capabilities, the available time, and any other choices they make.

**Lesson Phase C - Explore Simulator**
* If a group quickly comes up with a design, they can already start on the second lesson phase. Let them explore the simulator and try out the different functionalities they need. When the students have mastered the basics of the simulator, they can discover the rest while making their first virtual robot.
* The students design the body of the robot in the simulation field of the programming environment. The students then have a virtual robot.
* The students develop an algorithm and write it down, for example, in pseudocode (in the form of sentences) or using a flowchart.

**Lesson Phase D - Virtual Robot**
* Let the students work step by step when programming the virtual robot. They must formulate sub-problems and solve them independently. Test these sub-programs, correct any errors, and only combine them into the final program when they all work. The process of testing and debugging is very important here. Programming is not easy, and the students must experience that to write a good program, you need to test and adjust a lot until you get the desired result.

**Lesson Phase E - Conclusion**
* Let the students create a list of crafting materials they need to build their robot. You can provide this material yourself, but you can also have the students bring in boxes, wool, paper, etc. if desired.
