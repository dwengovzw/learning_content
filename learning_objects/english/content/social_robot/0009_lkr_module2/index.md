# Lesson plan
## Module 2: Brainstorm, programming, and material selection (Â± 3 hours)

*The link below will take you to Module 2 of 'Social Robot'* <br>
[Module 2: Brainstorm and programming](https://www.dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=sr2&language=en&te=true "Module 2")  

**Lesson Phase A - Introduction**
* Provide sufficient structure and guidance so that students do not get lost in their ideas. Brainstorming with students is not easy, so it is important to guide them properly.
* Give students the assignment for the brainstorming session. Clearly state the topic they should brainstorm about and what the outcome of the brainstorming session should be.
* If there are any limitations or criteria they need to consider, make sure to mention them now.
* *Extra*: Explain brainstorming techniques.

**Lesson Phase B - Brainstorm**
* Preferably, have students work in pairs or in groups of three for the 'Social Robot' project. During the brainstorming session, they should discuss what their robot should be able to do, how it should communicate, and what it should react to.
* After the brainstorming session, they need to present a final design. This can be in the form of a mind map or a written description. They should take into account the imposed criteria, the limitations of the kit, their own capabilities, the available time, and any other choices they make.

**Lesson Phase C - Exploring the simulator**
* If a group quickly comes up with a design, they can already start with the second lesson phase. Let them explore the simulator and try out the different functionalities they need. When the students have mastered the basics of the simulator, they can discover the rest while creating their first virtual robot.
* The students design the body of the robot in the simulation field of the programming environment. The students then have a virtual robot. 
* The students develop an algorithm and write it down, e.g., in pseudocode (in the form of sentences) or using a flowchart.

**Lesson Phase D - Virtual Robot**
* Have students work step by step when programming the virtual robot. They need to formulate sub-problems and solve them separately. Test these sub-programs, correct any errors, and only combine them into the final program when they all work.  
The process of testing and debugging is very important here. Programming is not easy, and students need to experience that to write a good program, they need to test and adjust it a lot until they achieve the desired result.

**Lesson Phase E - Conclusion**
* Have students create a list of crafting materials they need to build their robot. You can provide this material yourself, but you can also have the students bring boxes, yarn, paper, etc. if desired.
