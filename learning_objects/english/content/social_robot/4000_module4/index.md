<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
Make sure the students have a reminder of their robot: a video, a photo ... They will have to dismantle the robot.<br>
The robot body can be kept. The openings created by removing sensors and actuators can be filled with a printed or cardboard version. This way, the robot still looks like a robot.
