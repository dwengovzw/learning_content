# Objectives

## A social robot...

Social robots are robots specifically designed to interact with humans and participate in social interactions. The ultimate goal is to create a social robot where the interaction between humans and the machine is as natural as possible.

When designing a social robot, it is important to focus not only on the robot's efficiency in performing its tasks, but also on the social and emotional aspects of the interaction between the robot and the human. This requires knowledge from various domains such as engineering, human behavior, and design. Social robotics thus requires an interdisciplinary approach due to the complex interaction between the robot, its environment, and the people who come into contact with it.

### Design

The students have full control over the design of their social robot. They are the architects of their own creation and have the opportunity to express their unique vision and personal style in the design. This allows them to develop their technical and creative skills and a sense of pride in building a robot based entirely on their own ideas and insights.

Using reusable materials, crafting materials, and electronic components, the students have the opportunity to build their robot from scratch. Through this approach, they can not only develop their technical skills but also sharpen their creative and problem-solving skills.

### Programming

To introduce students to the principles of programming in an accessible way, they use the Dwengo simulator in this project. This simulator is designed for beginners who are looking for their first (graphical, i.e., block-based) programming experience. This foundation can help them in the future when transitioning to textual programming languages.

When programming the social robot, the students' computational thinking is sharpened and they gain insight into how the robot functions and reacts to the environment. By writing code and testing the functionality of the robot, they can improve their problem-solving skills.

### Building

As the final part of the project, the students must convert their virtual robot into physical reality.

The students are provided with reusable material and a microcontroller platform to build their robot. They must think about the materials they want to use and how they can combine these materials to construct the robot. It is also important that they take into account the functionality and design of the robot they have envisioned in the previous modules.

The construction process offers a wide range of possibilities that require various skills. It is therefore an ideal opportunity to integrate technology and design subjects in the project.
