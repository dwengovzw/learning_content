# Computational thinking unplugged
## Make a face
### 20 minutes in class

During this activity, students will gain important insights, such as:

* The fact that something that seems difficult at first can still be programmed with a few simple rules.
* The realization that programs are just rules followed by computers.
* The importance of breaking down a program into different parts to make it easier.

You can find the fully written activity with images [**here**](embed/maakeengezicht_activiteit.pdf "Activity 'Make a face'"). This activity was created by Paul Curzon, Queen Mary University of London.
