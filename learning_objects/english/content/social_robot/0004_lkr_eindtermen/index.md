# Learning outcomes

We assume that this project will mainly be taught in Technology or STEM classes. Therefore, we provide an overview of which learning outcomes can be achieved and how they can be achieved in [**this document**](embed/eindtermen_socialerobot.pdf "Learning outcomes"). 

You decide which learning outcomes and objectives to focus on. If you follow the approach proposed by Dwengo for the project as part of AI At School, certain learning outcomes should definitely be addressed.

**How you as a teacher implement this project will determine which learning outcomes are effectively addressed and to what extent.**

## Computational thinking

Computational thinking is essential when designing the robot. For example, students need to figure out which electronic components they need to make the robot do what they want, and they will write instructions in their own words on how the interaction with humans will occur.

Therefore, when working on this project, it is essential to understand and evaluate the computational skills of the students. This helps to determine which skills the students are using and which ones they still need to develop. It is important to guide the students and help them strengthen these skills.
