# The 'Social Robot' Project

'The Social Robot' is a fantastic way to get young students excited about STEM. It enables students to develop their creativity and technical skills by designing, programming, and building their own social robot. Moreover, this project aligns with current scientific research aimed at improving the interaction between humans and robots and the potential that social robots offer to contribute to various societal challenges.

It is an interdisciplinary STEM project for students in the first or second degree of secondary education, taking into account the final attainment levels and minimum goals of Flemish education.
