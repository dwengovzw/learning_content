# What are social robots?
## 20-40 minutes in the classroom
The 'Social Robot' project is best started with an introduction to social robots. What are social robots? Where are social robots used? What does the future with social robots look like? How can such a robot communicate and can it also show emotions? A social robot that is easy to get along with is able to simulate emotions.

For a more extensive context on social robots, we refer to the [robot booklet 'Hello robot!'](embed/SocialeRobot_handleiding_eerstedruk.pdf "Hello Robot!")
