# Unplugged Computational Thinking
## Emotion Machine
### Procedure

1. Give everyone the emotion machine sheet and ask them to do the following (as shown on the sheet):

* Cut along the black dotted line to get the emotion machine and a face with empty slots, plus 3 strips that can be slid through these slots.
* Weave the strips through the slots for the eyebrows, eyes, and mouth, so that the letters appear in the emotion machine and the eyebrows, eyes, and mouth appear on the face.

2. Now it's time to give the students the worksheets with the table. On these worksheets, they can fill in the table with the emotions they want to portray.

3. At the end, summarize the computer lessons of the activity. Programs consist of sequences of instructions that, when followed, lead to an action, such as a robot showing different emotions.

Computer instructions are essentially low-level code. Programming languages use high-level instructions to make writing programs easier. They use abstraction to hide the details of the low-level code. We can take a program with high-level instructions and compile it into a program that is effectively used to control the machine. Or we can use an interpreter that translates the instructions when we get to them.
