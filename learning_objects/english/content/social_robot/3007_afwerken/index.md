# Finishing the robot
Check your robot using the **technical drawing**:

* Have you implemented all functionalities?
* Does the program work as expected?
* Does your robot look as expected?

If yes, then you have achieved your objectives and you are done!

If you have extra time, you can consider adding additional functionalities to your robot. Perhaps you had ideas during the brainstorming that you would like to implement?
