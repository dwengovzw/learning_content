# Cleaning up

Unfortunately, at the end of the project, you will have to dismantle your robot ... Don't worry, you can keep most of the parts! You will only have to remove the electronics and store them in the box. In the box, you will find a list of which part goes where. Below, we also provide an overview of the contents:
