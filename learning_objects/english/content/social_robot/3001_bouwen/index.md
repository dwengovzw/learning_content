# Building the physical robot

During this lesson, you will finally get started with the material!

Make sure you have everything you need at hand before you start building your social robot. Below is a list of all the necessary materials and tools:

* the design of your robot;
* the material from which you will make the frame of your robot (a cardboard box, planks, ...);
* the electronics you will use;
* the template to cut out openings for the electronics;
* the tools you need, such as a cutting knife and ruler;
* possibly crafting materials such as glue and tape;
* the USB cable to connect the Dwenguino to your computer.

The video below summarizes what the next learning objectives describe.
