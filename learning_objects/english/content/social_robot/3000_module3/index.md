# Lesson Plan
## Module 3: Construction of the robot (Â± 3 class hours)

*The following link will take you to the student module* <br>
[Module 3: Building the Robot](https://www.dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=sr3&language=en "Module 3")

**Lesson Phase A - Collecting Materials**
* Students start with the construction of the physical robot. To do this, they first need to gather the necessary materials. Encourage the students to be creative in their approach.

**Lesson Phase B - Building the Robot**
* Students use the gathered materials to build the physical robot. Make sure to provide sufficient guidance!

**Lesson Phase C - Programming the Robot**
* Students test their program on the physical robot. They discover any errors and systematically work to correct them.
* Students check if their robot meets their own chosen requirements and the set criteria.
* If there is still time left, students can add additional features to their robot. They should always test the program in the simulator first and only transfer it to the physical robot if it works flawlessly there.

**Lesson Phase D - Conclusion**
* Students clean up their workspace.
* Students conduct self-evaluation and write down an improvement point.
* Assign a creative task for students to prepare for the next lesson. This can be a short presentation, a story about how their robot was built, or even a short sketch with their robot!
