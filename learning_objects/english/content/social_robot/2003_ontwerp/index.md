# Robot design

You now have all the basic knowledge you need to design your own social robot! You know what social robots are and how they work, and you understand how they function and "think".

Think about **your** social robot. What kind of robot do you want to create? How should your robot look? What should your robot be able to do?
Take a sheet of paper and write down your ideas. You can do this in both words and drawings!

Once you are satisfied with your design, formulate criteria based on which you will evaluate your robot in the end. These can be very diverse criteria depending on your design, but below are some examples:

- The robot has arms.
- The arms can move.
- The robot waves.
- The robot has eyes.
- The robot reacts when someone gets too close.
- The robot looks like a rhinoceros.
- ...

Wishing you lots of inspiration!
