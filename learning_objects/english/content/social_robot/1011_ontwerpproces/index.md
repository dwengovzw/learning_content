# The design process
## 10 - 20 minutes in the classroom
Now that the students have a rough concept of what social robots are, you can hold a short brainstorming session with the class to see if they can come up with the process for building such a social robot themselves.

The process in this learning path is as follows:
1. Designing the social robot
2. Writing the first version of the program
3. Simulating the program
4. Debugging the program
5. Making electrical circuits
6. Building the robot
7. Testing and debugging the robot
8. Finishing the robot

You can already tell the students that the process they will go through consists of several steps. It is now up to them to figure out what these steps entail.
