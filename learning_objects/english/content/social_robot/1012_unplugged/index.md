# Computational thinking unplugged
## 30 - 60 minutes in the classroom

The aim of these activities is to familiarize students with social robots and how they can communicate with people. The focus during the activities is on giving a human 'face' to a robot and programming emotions and facial expressions. To this end, we propose two tasks: 'make-a-face' and 'the emotion machine', where students learn to program without using a computer.
