# Preparation - Simulator
## At least 1.5 hours during class

### Preparation

We recommend that you, as a teacher, go through at least the basic exercises to be able to guide the students optimally. These cover the following elements:

* LCD screen
* Servo motor
* LED matrix
* RGB LED
* Sonar sensor
* Sound sensor

* Wait
* Loop structure
* Variables
* If-Then structure
* If-Then-Else structure

In this learning path, the *examples* for the essential blocks have already been included. For the exercise learning path, you can refer to [Module 2: Exercises](https://www.dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=sr2_exercises&language=en "Module 2: Exercises").

### What happens in the classroom?
It is not intended that you immediately give the students all the answers. Let them experiment with the simulator from time to time before helping them.

When the preparatory exercises are completed, they will be able to program their social robot independently.
