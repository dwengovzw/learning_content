# What are social robots?
## Humanisation

*People tend to attribute human qualities to objects.*

You have probably also encouraged your computer to work faster. And although a robot dog is a machine without real feelings, it is quickly seen as a pet.

> Discussion<br>Is it okay to kick a robot dog?

The **appearance** of a social robot influences the extent to which this 'humanization' occurs. The appearance of a robot creates **expectations**. If the robot does not live up to those expectations, it leads to disappointment for the user. From a robot with eyes, one expects that it sees, from a robot with wheels, that it drives...
The robot Paro, which looks like a seal, is treated by people as a pet, but does not create the expectations of a dog or cat. When creating the robot Paro, a seal was deliberately chosen instead of a dog or a cat, because a robot that looks like a dog or cat brings more expectations with it. A seal is something that people are familiar with, but apart from the appearance, they do not really know how a seal behaves, which creates less expectations.
From an android robot, a robot that looks very human, one also expects human actions. The robot Pepper does not look enough like a human to expect him to be very human-like.

If the expectations one has of the robot do not correspond to what it actually does, people experience the robot as something negative.
It is confusing when the body of a robot is partially covered by 'skin', but mechanical parts are also visible. It is strange when a robot animal talks.
People usually like robots that look like humans, but a robot cannot look too much like a human, otherwise they will not like it at all.
The phenomenon of how people react to robots is called *The Uncanny Valley*.
The more a robot looks like a human, the more human behaviors people will attribute to it and the greater the chance that the robot will not live up to those expectations.
