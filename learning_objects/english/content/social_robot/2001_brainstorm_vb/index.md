# Brainstorm & Design

The students now have all the basic skills they need to design their own social robot! They know what social robots are and how they work, and they understand how they function and "think".

To make designing their social robot smoother, here are some tips to help you support the students.


### Brainstorming Techniques

#### Technique 1: Brainwriting

The students write down as many ideas as possible on paper within an agreed time (for example, 5 minutes). While writing, they do not speak to each other or look at others' ideas.

Once the time is up, compare and discuss the ideas.

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
If you find that you can easily group certain ideas, it may be interesting to divide the students into groups based on similarities in their ideas at this time.
</div>


#### Technique 2: Mind Maps

They may have encountered this technique during their studies. However, it is also very useful during the brainstorming process.

Let the students write "Social Robot" in the middle of a sheet of paper. This is their starting point. They write down the things that this topic makes them think of around this starting point and connect them to the center using a line. They can then repeat this process with the new words as the starting point.

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
It may be useful not only to work with words but also to add drawings. In this way, some ideas and concepts can be better represented.

### Design

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
Give the students <strong>paper</strong> and <strong>markers</strong>. Encourage them to make drawings and try out different ideas.<br><br>

Make sure all students feel comfortable drawing and sharing their designs. Encourage them to be open to each other's ideas and to work together to improve their design. It may be interesting to show various examples (both "beautiful" and "ugly") of designs, making it clear that it is more important to make a functional sketch than a work of art.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-box alert-danger">
To not restrict the creativity of the students, it is recommended to first let the students design their <strong>dream robot</strong>.<br><br>

Afterward, you can then point out to them that this is not feasible within the context of the project. You go through the limitations together, such as the available materials and their own skills. This marks the second phase of the design process. The students consider what adjustments they need to make to their dream robot to obtain a new design that is feasible. This second design is called the <strong>technical drawing</strong>.
</div>

Once the students actually start the design process of the robot, they will exchange ideas about the appearance, functionalities, material...

They then brainstorm within their group about **their** social robot. If you notice that they are having difficulty finding a starting point or making progress, here are some sample questions that can help them get started:

* What should your robot look like?
* What should your robot be able to do?
* How will your robot be able to perceive people?
* How will your robot interact with people?
* Does your robot have a name?
* What can you achieve with the available material?
* What limitations or criteria should you take into account?
* ...

If a group wants to do too much, they will have to make choices:

* What should your robot be able to do at a minimum?
* What things can you possibly do later if there is time left?
* ...

Once they are satisfied with their design, they formulate criteria based on which they can evaluate their robot at the end. These criteria can be very diverse, depending on their design. Below are some examples:

* The robot has arms.
* The arms can move.
* The robot can wave.
* The robot has eyes.
* The robot reacts when someone comes too close.
* The robot resembles a rhinoceros.
* ...
