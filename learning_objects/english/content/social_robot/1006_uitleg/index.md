# What are social robots?
## Privacy

For children, there are numerous **'playmates'** on the market, to which they can become strongly attached, such as Furby.

However, these toy robots are not always well received. With the 'Internet of Toys', children are involved in a commercial, data-driven world. We must be aware that moral boundaries can be crossed. Children can be sensitive to what a robot asks or tells them to do. But also the privacy of the children is in danger.

Hello Barbie is a doll with which the child can have conversations thanks to voice recognition. The doll is connected to servers in the cloud and learns from previous conversations. Due to privacy concerns, this received a lot of criticism and the doll was taken off the market.

> Discussion<br>Is it okay for children and elderly people to tell their entire life story to a social robot that can store this information?

Conversations between children and their CloudPets teddy bear were hacked.
In Germany, the smart doll My Friend Cayla was banned because it can be used as a listening device by third parties.
Robotic dog Aibo may not be sold in the EU due to privacy reasons. For example, Aibo takes photos of your home that are stored in the cloud, and the conversations you have with Aibo also end up with the manufacturer.
