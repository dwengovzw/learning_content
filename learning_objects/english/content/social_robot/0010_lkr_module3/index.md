# Lesson Plan
## Module 3: Construction of the Robot (Â± 3 class hours)

*The link below will take you to module 3 of 'Social Robot'* <br>
[Module 3: Building the Robot](https://www.dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=sr3&language=en&te=true "Module 3")

**Lesson Phase A - Collecting Materials**
* The students start with the construction of the physical robot. To do this, they must first collect the materials they need. The students are encouraged to be creative in this process.

**Lesson Phase B - Building the Robot**
* The students start building the physical robot using the collected materials. Be sure to provide sufficient guidance!

**Lesson Phase C - Programming the Robot**
* The students test their program on the physical robot. They discover any errors and work systematically to correct them.
* The students check whether their robot meets their chosen requirements and the predetermined criteria.
* If there is still time left, the students can add additional functionalities to their robot. They always test the program first in the simulator and only when it works flawlessly there, they transfer it to the physical robot.

**Lesson Phase D - Conclusion**
* The students clean up their workplace.
* The students conduct self-evaluation and formulate a written improvement point.
* Give the students a creative assignment to prepare for the next lesson. This can be a short presentation, a story about how their robot came to be, or even a short sketch with their robot!
