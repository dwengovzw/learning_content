# Robot parts
Introduce the electronics that will be used during the lesson to the students. You can make this more interesting by asking them to guess what each component might be and what it is used for. The images used in the simulator to represent the real components are included in the learning path.

This learning path contains detailed descriptions of the actuators and sensors that will be used. In class, you can choose to shorten and simplify these descriptions.
