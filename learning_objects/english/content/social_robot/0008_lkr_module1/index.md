# Lesson Plan
## Module 1: Introduction and Unplugged Computational Thinking (Â± 2 hours)

*The following link will take you to module 1 of 'Social Robot'*<br>
[Module 1: What are social robots?](https://www.dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=sr1&language=nl&te=true "Module 1")  

**Lesson Phase A - What are social robots?**

*Option 1*
* Start the lesson with a presentation with photos of social robots that already exist in society, such as Pepper, Paro, Aibo or a Hatchimal. You can then further analyze these to discuss sensors and actuators and link them to 'input-processing-output'.

*Option 2*
* Have the students draw a sketch of the robot of their dreams. Then discuss as a class whether there are also social robots among them. Finally, discuss some social robots that already exist in society.


**Lesson Phase B - Unplugged Computational Thinking**
* After the introduction, provide a short break to set up the active working methods.
* Activity 1: Make-a-Face (classwide)
* Activity 2: Emotion Machine (groups of 3-4)
* Make sure you still have enough time to clean up and go through the final lesson phase.


**Lesson Phase C - Exploring Electronics**
* End the lesson by exploring the sensors and actuators in the kit of the 'Social Robot' project. The students should limit themselves to a selection of the parts in the kit and reusable materials when building the physical body of their own social robot.


**Lesson Phase D - Conclusion**
* Form the groups in which the students will create their social robots.
* Optionally, give them homework to think (together) about their social robot in preparation for the brainstorming that will start the next lesson. 
* Extra: The students can be given an assignment as preparation for the next lesson. For example, they can search the world wide web for a social robot in a context that strongly appeals to them and create a digital document about it.
