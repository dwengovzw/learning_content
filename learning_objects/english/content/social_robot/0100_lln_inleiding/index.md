# The 'Social Robot' Project

![](@youtube/https://www.youtube.com/embed/EsYs4k41U6w?list=PLHRY06NDfDXlBpLm5J3BK26Ul6GxGykDu "Introduction Social Robot")

*Welcome to the 'Social Robot' project! In this project, you will get started on building your own social robot!*

"But... how do you get started? How do you make such a *'social robot'*?"

Building a social robot is not an easy task, but if you break down the problem into smaller sub-problems, it already seems less difficult.

* *How do I design a social robot?*
* *How do I program a social robot?*
* *How do I build a social robot?*

This is already a bit more concrete! It's time to get started!
