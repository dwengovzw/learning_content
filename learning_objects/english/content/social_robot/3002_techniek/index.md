# Building the physical robot
## Cutting out the openings

### Marking the box
It is important to carefully consider where you will attach the electronics to the box before you start cutting or poking holes. Mistakes can be difficult to undo once you have started. Make sure to leave enough space around the edges of the openings for wiring.

To help you with this, you can use the template for the electrical components that is included with the SR kit.

Use a thin pen to mark the correct places on the box.

### Cutting the openings

The openings can be cut out using a **knife** or by poking with the provided **awl** in the designated slots.

**Safety instructions**

1. Be careful when handling cutting tools.

2. Only pick up the cutting tool when you need it immediately.

3. Lay down the tool when others are nearby or turn away from them.

4. Don't startle others who are holding sharp tools, as they may injure themselves.

5. Keep the sharp edge of the cutting tool away from yourself and others.

6. Never hand the cutting tool directly to someone else. Put it down in a safe place where it can't roll away, and let the other person pick it up themselves.

7. Stay focused when cutting or poking or holding the tool. Don't get distracted and don't distract others.

8. Always cut on a stable surface so that the knife or awl cannot slip. Use the provided cutting mat for this.
