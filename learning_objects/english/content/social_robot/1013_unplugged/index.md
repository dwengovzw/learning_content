# Unplugged computational thinking

Social robots are robots that are capable of communicating with humans in various ways. During the following activities, you will learn how to program emotions and facial expressions in robots.

These activities fall under the category of 'unplugged computational thinking', which means that you will be "programming" without a computer.
