# Conclusion
Congratulations, you have successfully completed the project!
We hope you enjoyed it and that your interest in robotics has been piqued!

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
During the project, you learned a lot of things, such as:
<br>
<ul>
<li>what a social robot is;</li>
<li>where social robots are found in the real world;</li>
<li>how social robots work;</li>
<li>how a design process works;</li>
<li>how to program a robot;</li>
<li>how a robot 'thinks';</li>
</ul>

and ultimately, <strong>how to design, program, and build a social robot yourself</strong>!
