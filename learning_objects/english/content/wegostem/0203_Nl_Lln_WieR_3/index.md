# What is a robot?

*Robot versus animal?* 

A robot is sometimes compared to an animal. That comparison leads to interesting questions. Does an animal have sensors? With which part of an animal can you compare a robot’s motors? And does the wiring have an animal equivalent? 

It’s food for discussion, but the following interpretation does make sense: 

* The processing unit is the brain of the robot and corresponds to the brain of an animal. A robot can only perform a task if its processing unit is programmed for it. 

* The motors make the robot move, so you could compare them to the muscles of an animal. 
* The sensors are the robot's senses. Through its sensors, the robot gathers information from its environment. 

* Part of the wiring forms the robot's nervous system. Through these wires, signals are sent: on the one hand from the processing unit to the motors and sensors, and on the other hand from the sensors to the processing unit. 

* Another part of the wiring provides the transport of the necessary energy. These are the blood vessels. Animals obtain energy from their food, for example the energy they need to move their muscles. Robots get their energy from their batteries. They use the electricity supplied by the batteries to move their motors. 

So how does an animal differ from a robot? The difference lies mainly in the way an animal makes decisions. An animal takes the circumstances into account, consciously or not. A robot moves only when its processing unit commands it to. If something is wrong with the program, if the relevant sensor is broken, or if the robot has too little energy, then the robot does not do what it should. That does not apply to an animal, since the animal brain is capable of devising solutions to problems.
