# Try programming a human

![](embed/PeeMKind.jpg "Try programming a human")

#### Introduction
In order for robots to be able to do meaningful things, they must be programmed. That means they must receive unambiguous instructions. After all, robots cannot interpret; they carry out every instruction you give them literally. Writing those instructions is called programming.

The programmer’s challenge is to solve problems by breaking them down into small steps that can be executed by the computer.

#### Materials
For this assignment you only need pencil and paper.

#### Skills
A robot only does what you program it to do. So you must give very precise instructions. You learn to solve a relatively difficult problem by splitting it into small steps.

#### Assignment
Choose one programmer. The others are robots. The programmer describes the drawing to the class, and the robots copy it. The robots are not allowed to talk or ask questions during the drawing process!  
The goal is to see how quickly and accurately the drawing is reproduced. **So do not show the original drawing to the robots until they are finished drawing!**

1. Start by using a simple image for this exercise.
2. Discuss the result. What went well? What went less well? Are all the shapes the same size? Were you able to carry out the instructions in different ways?
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 with different programmers and images.
