# Programming the drawing robot

Your robot is assembled. Now we’re going to program it. We will say very precisely what it has to do. But because the robot doesn’t speak human language, we’ll first learn a programming language. We do that in dwenguinoBlockly, a programming environment for children like you!

dwenguinoBlockly has two major advantages:

1. It is adapted to your age (upper primary and lower secondary school).
2. It is a graphical programming language. Programming is as simple as dragging blocks on the screen.
3. There is a simulator. On the screen you can already see what the robot will do.

In the next steps of this learning path, you will learn to work with dwenguinoBlockly. First in the simulator, afterwards with your own robot.

Good luck!
