# Preparation - Building a drawing robot 
## 20 - 30 minutes during the lesson

### What happens in the classroom?
In this activity, students will work with physical materials for the first time. They learn about the different components of a robotic arm and must assemble them correctly. This is how they build their own drawing robot.

Each group receives a photo. Based on this photo, the children can usually figure out for themselves how to build the drawing robot. If they do get stuck, you can provide some extra explanation. You can see the steps needed to build the robot in the following video:
