# Broken equipment?

Is something broken? First of all, don't panic. 

###### **Green box**
In the green box you'll find spare parts. If something doesn't work, you can replace it with an item from this box.

###### **Red box**
Put the non-working items in the red box.

That way, the 15 robot sets remain complete and only the spares box needs to be replenished/checked by the WeGoSTEM team. Will you also give your WeGoSTEM buddy a heads-up?
