## Conclusion

You can see that it is not always easy to give clear instructions. If you want to have a computer draw a specific house, for example, "Draw a house" is much too vague for the computer. What is the shape of the house? How big should the house be? Where on the page should the computer start drawing? You discovered that yourself during the assignment. It may have been frustrating for the robots that they were not allowed to ask questions. But a real robot cannot do that on its own either!

Computers cannot interpret. They execute every instruction you give them literally. As a programmer, you must therefore break tasks down into small, clear steps. Steps that the computer can execute. And of course you have to pass the instructions on to the computer as clearly as possible.
