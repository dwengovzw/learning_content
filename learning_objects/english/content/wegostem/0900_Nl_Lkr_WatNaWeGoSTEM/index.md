# What's next after WeGoSTEM?

During the preparation for WeGoSTEM, you were introduced to the dwenguinoBlockly-simulator. If your school has a computer lab, then you can schedule exercises for a number of lessons. You can find these exercises [**here**](https://dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=pc_starttodwenguino&language=nl&te=true&source_page=%2Fphysical_computing%2F&source_title=%20Physical%20computing#g_inleiding_lkr;nl; "extra simulator exercises").

So that it doesn't stop there, we wrote the booklet ['I can already program'](https://scholen.dwengo.org/downloads/ikkanalprogrammeren.pdf "robot booklet"), to support teachers, with possible lesson ideas on computational thinking and programming. All the activities included require only a minimum of materials. For example, no software needs to be installed, and for some activities no computer is even needed.
