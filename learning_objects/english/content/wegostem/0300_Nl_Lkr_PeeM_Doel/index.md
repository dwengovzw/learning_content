# Preparation - Program a human 
## 10 - 15 minutes during class

### What happens in the classroom?
The students program each other to make a drawing. One student is the ‘programmer’ and gives careful instructions to the other students to reproduce a specific drawing. The other students are ‘the computer’. How quickly and accurately is the drawing completed?

*Why this exercise?*

Students learn how to solve a relatively difficult problem by breaking it down into small steps. They must give very precise instructions and in the correct order. 
Note: Keep an eye on the time!

## Preparation
### Materials

* Pen and paper (bring your own)
* [Images](embed/WeGoSTEMmensrobot.pdf "Images Program a human") for the exercise (also provided). Start with the simplest drawing!
