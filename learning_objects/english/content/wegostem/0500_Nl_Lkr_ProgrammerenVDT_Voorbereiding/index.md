# Preparation - Programming the Drawing Robot 
## 40 min during the lesson

### What happens in the classroom?

*Content*

The students now have a robot and want to activate it. But first they still need to program it. They learn that in the next steps of the learning path. 


*Step by step*

Thanks to the learning path, students learn to work independently and in an exploratory way. First in a simulator, then for real. In a number of sub-steps they discover different ways to control their robot. That way they learn to: 

1. Write their name on the LCD screen.
2. Make the robot start only when a button is pressed.
3. Run the motors so that the robot draws.
4. Experiment with the mechanics and speed of the motors.

Tip: Have students start programming only when they have finished building their drawing robot.


*Working independently*

As a teacher, you don't have to spoon-feed the students. Feel free to let them experiment.


### Preparation

It is important that the children get to work themselves in the learning path. They learn to work with the LCD screen, the wait function, and buttons. For each of these functions, students receive information and exercises. This should be sufficient.

If the students still have questions, they will surely come to you. We therefore recommend that, as a teacher, you also go through the basic exercises of the *StartTodwenguino* pathway. That way you will be able to guide the students optimally. You do not need to follow the entire pathway. Only the parts about the LCD screen, the wait function, and buttons are relevant within the WeGoSTEM pathway.

In what follows, as a teacher you can already look at a number of examples for these essential blocks. Could you use even more help? Then we would be happy to refer you to the *StartTodwenguino* pathway.


### Materials for in the classroom

* Computers with an internet connection
* Assembled drawing robot (included)
