# What is a robot?

*Which robots have you seen?* 

In 1495, Leonardo da Vinci designed a 'mechanical lion' that could move based on mechanical principles. However, it was not until 1961 that industry welcomed its first robot: the Unimate. This robotic arm could be programmed to perform tasks autonomously. Advanced variants of the Unimate are still used today, for example for microsurgery.

In parallel with the development of such industrial robots, researchers began in 1950 to systematically build legged robots. The most well-known descendants of this are undoubtedly Honda’s ASIMO (which has a human form) and Sony’s Aibo (a robot dog).

Moreover, researchers are not only concerned with mechanical construction: they are also increasingly focusing on the social skills of robots. KISMET at MIT, from the 1990s, for example, smiles at you. Robots with facial expressions are used, among other things, as reception staff in hotels or hospitals.
