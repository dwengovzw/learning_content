# What is WeGoSTEM?

Are you a teacher in the third stage of primary education? Do you want to get students excited about engineering and computer science? Then WeGoSTEM is the right place for you. We provide you with all the materials to build and program an art robot with your students. A robot that can draw on its own. This way, your students acquire a host of STEM skills, from technology to computational thinking.

That sounds almost too good to be true. Yet it works. More than 25,000 children all over Europe have already worked with the materials. A lot of thought has gone into WeGoSTEM. The lesson content is logically structured, aligns well with the students’ abilities, and fits exactly into two lesson periods:

###### **First lesson period**
* a class discussion about robots (10 - 15 min);
* try programming a human (10 - 15 min);
* building a drawing robot (25 min);
  
###### **Second lesson period**
* programming the drawing robot and experimenting (40min);
* clean up (10 min).

# How does it work?

Would you like to get started? Then read on. In what follows, we will guide you through the WeGoSTEM learning path. You will discover the various activities we have developed for your students. With each activity, you get a brief explanation. This way, the learning path prepares you perfectly to support your students when they start the learning path themselves.

Note, in this lesson the students build a robot themselves. You can reserve the materials they need for this free of charge at a library in your area.

If you have additional knowledge about robots, feel free to share it with the students! The time indications are suggestions, but can of course be adapted to the needs of the class. 

In any case, children are wildly enthusiastic when they can go home with their own robot drawing!

If you still have questions after the learning path, you can always contact us at [scholen@dwengo.org](scholen@dwengo.org"email").
