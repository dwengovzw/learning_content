# Cleaning up

**Don't worry, you don't have to start cleaning up right away now that you're done with the exercises! Just keep programming calmly until your teacher lets you know it's time to clean up.**

First reset the Dwenguino via the X in DwenguinoBlockly. Follow the same process as when uploading a program. If the reset is successful, *'dwenguino ;)'* will appear on the LCD screen.  
Then neatly take everything apart and put everything back in the box. That way the next class can get to work with it as well.
