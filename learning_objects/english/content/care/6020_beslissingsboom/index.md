# Decision tree
Divide the students in your class based on their hobbies, hair and eye color, or height.<br>
You can do that by coming up with yes-no questions and drawing a decision tree on the playground.<br><br>
Start with the first question. If the answer is yes, go to the next question on the right. If the answer is no, go to the question on the left. Continue until you end up in a category.<br>
Are you and your classmates in the right category? Fantastic! If not, think about which questions weren't chosen so well and adjust them.
