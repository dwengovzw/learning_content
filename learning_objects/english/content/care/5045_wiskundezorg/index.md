# Mathematics 
## Final objectives for mathematics and the '*AI in Healthcare*' project 

*Final objective 6.5/6.6 - Sign and computation rules of operations - With context* 

In the formula of the Gini index, the students use the operation ‘product’ and apply the sign rules. 


*Final objective 6.8/6.9 - Relationship between table, graph, and function rule, input-output model - With context* 

To formulate the Gini index, the students first plot three points of a function in a coordinate system and draw a possible graph of the function. By estimating the shape of the function’s graph, they can then determine the function rule. Using that function rule, they can enter the value of p (input) and obtain the Gini index (output). 


*Final objective 6.10 (Double finality) - Characteristics of a function - With context* 

When setting up and interpreting the Gini index, the students take into account the zeros, increasing and decreasing behavior, and the maximum of the function involved. They also had to do this when sketching the graph by hand from the table. 


*Final objective 6.11 (Throughput finality) - Determine the rule of a quadratic function - With context* 

The students establish the function rule of the downward-opening parabola that corresponds to the Gini index. They do this using the graph in which the coordinates of the vertex are known.<br>
When setting up and interpreting the Gini index, the students take into account the zeros, the axis of symmetry, the vertex, and the fact that it is a downward-opening parabola. 


*Final objective 6.13 (Throughput finality) - Characteristics of a function - With context* 

When setting up and interpreting the Gini index, the students take into account the zeros, increasing and decreasing behavior, the maximum of the function involved, and the axis of symmetry. They also had to do this when sketching the graph by hand from the table. 


*Final objective 6.12/6.18 - The distribution of a quantity in a dataset - With context* 

With Python code, the students convert the categorical data in the provided datasets into numerical data to be compatible with the Python functions used. The students are presented with quite a few datasets with ‘real’ data.<br> 
These data can optionally be used to practice absolute and relative frequency, bar chart, dot plot, pie chart, line chart, histogram, box plot, arithmetic mean, median, quartile, and interquartile range. 


*Final objective 6.17 (Throughput finality) - Graphs - With context* 

The students are introduced to graphs. What are: a graph, a node, an edge, a walk, a path, a cycle, a connected graph, and a tree? The students identify walks and paths in graphs.<br>
Decision trees are directed graphs. In the ’AI in Healthcare’ project, the decision tree serves as a solution to a socially relevant problem within a healthcare context.<br>
The students work with a divide-and-conquer algorithm to develop a decision tree from data. 


*Final objective 6.20 (Throughput finality) - Logical expressions - With context* 

The students translate a path in a decision tree into a logical statement in symbols and into a statement in words. To do this, the students must know the meaning of negation, conjunction, disjunction, and implication. 


*Final objective 6.13/6.22 - Mathematize and demathematize a problem, argue - With context* 

The students work with a dataset to gain insight into a medical problem: which parameters are important for (the evolution of) that medical problem? A decision tree offers a solution to that problem. Once that decision tree has been set up, the students have a system that allows them to enter the values of the parameters for a new patient and, e.g., predict which diagnosis those parameters translate into or how a medical situation will evolve.<br>
The students recognize that the output of a decision tree is transparent.
