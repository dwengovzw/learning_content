# Triage in the emergency department
You can be unlucky sometimes and end up at the hospital’s emergency department.<br>
And then you’ve been waiting there for an hour, and a new patient comes in who gets treated right away. <br>
That’s because healthcare providers use triage. For example, they measure your blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature, and based on a questionnaire they determine how urgently you need help. And yes, people who need help very urgently sometimes see a doctor sooner, even though they arrived at the emergency department later.   

This video from the hospital in Geel clarifies this:
