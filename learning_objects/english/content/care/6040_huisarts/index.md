# Should I see a doctor?
With the application Should I see a doctor? you can easily and quickly find out whether and when you should see a doctor. That can be useful, for example, on the weekend, because you usually can't reach your GP for advice then.

This app shows how a decision tree works in practice.<br><br>
Thanks to the team of Should I see a doctor? you can try the app below.<br>
You can choose the language of the app.

It is not intended that you use the application outside an educational context. For that, you should visit a webpage of a healthcare provider who also offers the app.

### How?
In the app you answer a series of simple questions. For example, you are asked about your age or you see a question you can answer with yes or no.<br>
Based on data such as your age, your sex, and your symptoms, the app will give you advice. For example, that you should call 112 immediately or that you can wait until the next day to see your GP.

The questions and the advice in the app are carefully compiled by a team of triage specialists.

Possible advice: <br>
- Call 112 or the GP out-of-hours service immediately
- Call 112 or your own GP immediately
- Call the GP out-of-hours service immediately
- Call your own GP immediately
- Call the GP out-of-hours service
- Call your own GP
- Call the GP out-of-hours service
- Contact your own GP
- Contact your own GP the next working day
- You don't need to see a doctor (the patient does receive self-care advice here)

### Class discussion
- Do you find this app useful?
- Would you use the app yourself?
- For what purpose might this app have been developed?

### Assignment 1
View the list of presenting complaints you see for abdominal complaints.
- Compare these complaints for someone who was born male and someone who was born female. What do you notice?
- What does this mean for the decision tree if you wanted to draw it?

### Assignment 2
- Look for another body part where you see a different list of presenting complaints for male and female.
- Look for a body part where you see the same list of presenting complaints for male and female.
- Look for a body part where, depending on age, you see a different list of presenting complaints.

### Assignment 3
- Discover a condition where the advice does not depend on sex.
- Discover a condition where the advice does depend on sex.
