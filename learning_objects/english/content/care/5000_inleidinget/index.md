# Introduction 

The teacher decides which learning objectives are addressed in the ‘AI in Healthcare’ project. This project is an integrated STEM project. So [STEM attainment targets](https://onderwijsdoelen.be "STEM attainment targets") are certainly covered. <br>
The discipline 'M' is necessary to develop an algorithm for constructing a decision tree; the design itself falls under the discipline 'E'. <br>Under 'S', computer science is included (in conjunction with 'E'). If a practical for a natural science is also carried out, that also falls under 'S'. The use of the computer falls under 'T'.<br>
The attainment targets of [‘Digital competence and media literacy’](https://onderwijsdoelen.be "Attainment targets for digital competence and media literacy") for the second and third stage can certainly be addressed, in particular the attainment targets on 'Computational thinking and acting'.<br><br>
The linked attainment targets are included here.
