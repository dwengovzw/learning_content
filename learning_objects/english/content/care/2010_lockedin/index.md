# The locked-in syndrome 
The locked-in syndrome is one of the worst medical conditions.

You are completely paralyzed, except that you might still be able to blink one eye. Your intelligent mind is trapped in a useless body: you can feel everything but cannot communicate. 

It can happen to anyone, out of the blue, as a result of a stroke. 

If you wanted to help people with locked-in syndrome, should you become a doctor or nurse? Or can you also help as a computer scientist? 

This example (with thanks to Paul Curzon) makes it clear that computational thinking is about people, and that when designing the solution to a problem it is best to involve the person for whom it is intended. It also illustrates that by thinking computationally, an existing solution might be made more efficient. 

A full elaboration of a related case according to the principles of computational thinking can be found [here](https://www.dwengo.org/backend/api/learningObject/getWrapped?hruid=ct03_12&version=3&language=nl).
