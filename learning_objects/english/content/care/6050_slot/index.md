# Conclusion
Decision trees are a widely used technique within artificial intelligence. This technique has the advantage that it is very transparent (or see-through). Decision trees are very clear.
If a computer makes a decision based on a decision tree, you can easily see how that decision was made. Because it is easy to understand, the technique is well accepted.
