# Social networks

A group of people who interact with each other forms a **_social network_**. Not everyone interacts with the same people; therefore there are many social networks. The way we interact can also differ. So there are different forms of social networks. They can be groups of friends in the physical world, or groups of friends in the digital world, such as on Facebook. 

The whole of who is in contact with whom is therefore called a *social network*. On Facebook, the connections between friends are *not directed*. On Instagram, the connections between the follower and the followed are *directed*.

Social networks are also modeled mathematically by means of **graphs**.  
The *nodes* of the graph are, e.g., the people with a Facebook account, and friends are connected to each other by the *edges*. 

The example below concerns students and the contacts between these students. The nodes represent the students. As is customary in a genogram, a graphical representation used to depict relationships between people, circles represent girls and squares represent boys. <br>
The contacts between students are shown by line segments between nodes, and are therefore the *edges* of the graph. <br>
Thus, among the children between 4 and 5 years old, you can see a clique of boys who are friends with a small group of girls and also with another girl. That girl is friends with yet another boy. There are also two girls who are only friends with each other and six children without friends.

A figure is useful for examining what the network looks like.
