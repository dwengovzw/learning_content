# Computational thinking

We live in a technological knowledge society, rapidly changing due to ongoing developments in digitization, the unstoppable flow of information, and the rise of artificial intelligence. It is important that people can adopt a resilient and flexible attitude toward new digital applications. Knowing how to use them is not enough. Computational thinking is a way of working to understand the digital world and to intervene in it. By gaining insights into the concepts that underlie digitization, you can better assess the possibilities, limitations, and potential risks of these applications, which also removes fear of technology. Being able to think computationally can thus help you function better in and participate in the digitized society, and understand the interaction between technological developments and the evolutions in society. 

> It is about understanding the impact of digitization on your own life and being able to make well-founded decisions as a citizen in the future. 

## What does computational thinking involve? 

The final attainment targets for Flemish secondary education are accompanied by a definition of computational thinking and acting, which can be read in the box ‘Definition accompanying the starting points of the attainment targets‘. 

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
    <strong>Definition accompanying the starting points of the attainment targets</strong><br>
    "Computational thinking and acting is a process by which one arrives at output using the following techniques: recognizing patterns (pattern recognition) and generalizing (generalization), breaking a problem into subproblems (decomposition), abstracting from the data or the problem itself (abstraction), shaping the solution method (modeling), and following a fixed step-by-step plan (algorithms).”
</div> 

These principles also clarify that these are skills that "help students gain a better overview of complex problems [...] to understand how a computer works and [...] to be able to use the computer as a tool to solve a problem".<br> 
Taking into account this definition and what is internationally understood by computational thinking, we propose the definition in the box 'An <em>alternative</em> definition'.

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
<strong>An <em>alternative</em> definition</strong><br>
Computational thinking is a methodology for tackling a complex problem in such a way that you could use a computer to solve it.
</div> 

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
Computational thinking rests on four basic concepts: decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition, and algorithmic thinking, but also includes other concepts and practices. 

For a given problem these basic concepts are often intertwined. Computational thinking entails properly understanding and formulating the problem to be solved, devising a solution, and formulating an algorithm and, if necessary, implementing it on the computer. 

An important aspect is recognizing problems for which it is worthwhile to use the computer as a tool. 

For some problems this is an efficient methodology for arriving at a solution, or this methodology makes it easier to employ the computer to solve the problem. 

The term 'computer' is used in the broad sense of the word: the entirety of hardware and software of computers, smartphones, tablets, and other information-processing systems.
</div> 

In both definitions four basic concepts of computational thinking are highlighted: decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition, and algorithm. There is international consensus about these basic concepts. 

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
<strong>Definitions of the basic concepts</strong><br>

<ul><li><strong>Decomposition</strong></br>- Thoughtfully splitting a problem into well-chosen subproblems, so that each part can be addressed separately and a solution to the problem is obtained more easily.</li></ul> 
<ul><li><strong>Pattern recognition</strong></br>- Discovering that certain aspects of a problem resemble each other, allowing it to be simplified.<br>- Recognizing that a problem shows similarities with a previously solved problem.</li></ul> 
<ul><li><strong>Abstraction</strong></br>- Ignoring information not needed to solve a problem.<br>- Hiding certain details to be able to think about a problem in broad terms.</li></ul> 

When tackling complex problems, abstraction is necessary, because reasoning proceeds more smoothly without the ballast of irrelevant details. 

<ul><li><strong>Algorithmic thinking</strong></br>- Making explicit a sequence of unambiguous instructions that must be executed step by step.<br>- Realizing that this sequence of instructions and their order are essential to produce the desired result.</li></ul> 
</div>
However, computational thinking is not limited to these basic concepts, but also includes other concepts and practices, such as problem solving, debugging, representing and modeling data ...

The definition by Denning & Tedre emphasizes this broader picture; see the box 'Definition by Denning and Tedre'. 

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
<strong>Definition by Denning and Tedre</strong><br>
Denning and Tedre give the following definition of computational thinking (Denning & Tedre, 2019): 

<em>"Computational thinking is the mental skills and practices for<br>
<ul><li>designing computations that get computers to do jobs for us, and</li></ul>
<ul><li>explaining and interpreting the world as a complex of information processes."</li></ul>
</em> 

"Computational thinking includes the cognitive skills and the practices for<br>
<ul><li>designing computations and instructions that ensure computers perform tasks for us, and</li></ul>
<ul><li>explaining and interpreting the world as a complex system of information processes."</li></ul>
