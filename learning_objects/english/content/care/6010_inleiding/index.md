# Introduction
Doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers can use help when making a diagnosis or choosing an appropriate treatment.<br>
Decision trees can be very helpful for that. You have to answer simple questions, e.g., questions you can answer with yes or no, and based on that they help with making decisions. <br>
For example, if you go to the emergency room, they also ask you all kinds of questions to determine how urgent your request for help is.
