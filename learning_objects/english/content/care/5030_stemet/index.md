# STEM
## STEM attainment targets 
These attainment targets belong to the attainment targets Mathematics - natural sciences - technology - STEM. They are formulated in the same way for the second and third stage. This does not necessarily apply to conceptual and procedural knowledge. 

<em>
<ul><li>6.54/6.40 (Higher education pathway) Students analyze natural and technical systems using various STEM concepts. (Analyze).</li></ul>
<ul><li>6.15/6.17 and 6.30/6.21 (respectively Labour market pathway and Dual pathway) Students analyze natural and technical systems using provided STEM concepts. (Analyze).</li></ul>
<ul><li>6.55/6.41 and 6.31/6.22 (respectively Higher education pathway and Dual pathway) Students design a solution to a problem by applying concepts and practices from different STEM disciplines in an integrated way. (Create).</li></ul>
<ul><li>6.16/6.18 (Labour market pathway) Students design a solution to a problem by applying concepts and practices from different STEM disciplines in an integrated way. (Create).</li></ul>
<ul><li>6.56/6.42 (Higher education pathway) Students justify, from different perspectives, choices in the design and use of technical systems and other STEM solutions. (Evaluate).</li></ul>
<ul><li>6.17/6.19 and 6.32/6.23 (respectively Labour market pathway and Dual pathway) Students justify, from different perspectives, choices in the use of technical systems. (Evaluate).</li></ul>
<ul><li>6.57/6.43 (Higher education pathway) Students investigate, using concrete societal challenges, the interaction between STEM disciplines among themselves and between STEM disciplines and society. (Analyze).</li></ul>
<ul><li>6.18/6.20 and 6.33/6.24 (respectively Labour market pathway and Dual pathway) Students explain, using concrete societal challenges, the interaction between STEM disciplines among themselves and between STEM disciplines and society. (Understand).</li></ul>
