## Mathematics attainment targets, second stage 

<em>
<ul><li>6.5/6.6 (Dual finality/Transfer finality) Students express, in a formula, one variable as a function of the other. (Apply).</li></ul>
<ul><li>6.8/6.9 (Dual finality/Transfer finality) Students relate different representations of a function, namely verbal description, table, graph, and formula. (Understand).</li></ul>
<ul><li>6.10 (Dual finality) Students relate features of a function to the meaningful situation described by the function. (Analyze).</li></ul>
<ul><li>6.11 (Transfer finality) Students determine the formula or a graph of a quadratic function when the other representation is given. (Analyze).</li></ul>
<ul><li>6.13 (Transfer finality) Students investigate the characteristics of f ( x ) = c/x ( c ∈ R 0 ) , linear and quadratic functions. (Analyze).</li></ul>
<ul><li>6.12/6.18 (Dual finality/Transfer finality) Students investigate the distribution of a single variable in a dataset in relation to the problem statement or research question that led to the data collection. (Analyze).</li></ul>
<ul><li>6.17 (Transfer finality) Students use graphs to solve problems. (Apply).</li></ul>
<ul><li>6.20 (Transfer finality) Students determine the truth value of logical statements. (Apply).</li></ul>
<ul><li>6.13/6.22 (Dual finality/Transfer finality) Students solve problems by mathematizing and demathematizing and by using heuristics. (Analyze).</li></ul>
