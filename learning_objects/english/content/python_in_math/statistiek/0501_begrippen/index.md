# Some concepts

## Absolute and relative frequency

In this part of the learning path you take your first steps in working with Python for large datasets.

In a first notebook you learn how to **import externally stored datasets** and how you can query basic things such as absolute and relative frequency, and the size of a dataset, with Python.<br>
In a second notebook, you apply what you've learned to a **real-world dataset**.
