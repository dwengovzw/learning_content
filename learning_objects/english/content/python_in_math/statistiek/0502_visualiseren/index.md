# Visualizing data

## Pie chart, bar chart, and histogram

When you work with data, it is important that you visualize that data in an **appropriate** way.

A pie chart (or circle chart), bar chart, histogram, box plot, and scatter plot are different ways to present data. But not every representation is always equally suitable. <br>
A pie chart is usually not the best choice because people are not good at comparing the proportions between the sizes of the different circular sectors. If there are more than 5 sectors, it is better to choose a different representation than a pie chart.


In three notebooks you will work with datasets; some are quite large. <br>
You will learn to visualize data with Python in a pie chart, bar chart, or a histogram.

More about the importance of data visualization can be found in the learning pathway 'Scatter Plot' > [Importance of Visualization](https://dwengo.org/en/learning-path.html?hruid=maths_spreidingsdiagrammen&language=en&te=true&source_page=%2Fen%2Fmath_with_python%2F&source_title=%20Math%20with%20Python#pn_belangvisualisatie;en;3).

In this [presentation](embed/databelangvisualisatie.pdf), you will see additional examples, including misleading graphs and the difference between a bar chart and a histogram.
