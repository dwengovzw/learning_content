# Normal distribution

A **random variable** is a variable whose value depends on chance.<br>
A **probability distribution** contains all possible outcomes of a random variable together with the corresponding probability that an outcome occurs. 

Random variables, such as height, weight, IQ, the mass of a packet of sugar, the results of a physics experiment, and the scores on the math olympiad are *continuously* distributed. They can take any real values within a certain interval. The graph of that continuous distribution also has certain characteristics; it is a **normal distribution**.<br>
The values that such a random variable takes are symmetric with respect to the mean value. A large proportion of the values will not deviate much from the mean, whereas extremely large or extremely small values occur infrequently.<br> 
The graph of the normal distribution is a so-called **Gaussian curve** and has the shape of a *bell*.<br>
The corresponding function is called a **probability distribution function** or probability density function.

In the first notebook you learn to use Python to plot the graphs of the normal and standard normal distributions. You also learn how to use Python to compute probabilities in this context.<br>
In the second notebook you apply what you have learned to a large real-world dataset.
