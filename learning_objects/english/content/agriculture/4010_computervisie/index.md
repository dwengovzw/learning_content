# Computer Vision
Object detection can be defined as a computer vision technique that aims to locate objects in an image or video and, by means of a classification technique, identify them.<br>
Although object detection systems are already used in many places in society today, there is still plenty of room for improvement.<br> 
In the first notebook, several practical examples are given and you will learn a bit more about how an object detection system works.<br>
In the second notebook, you will work with an existing object detection algorithm: YOLO.
