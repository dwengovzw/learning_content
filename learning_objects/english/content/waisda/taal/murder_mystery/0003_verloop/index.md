# Flow

This activity follows the principle of an escape room/murder mystery. Participants start in a room where clues are hidden. They can use these clues to unravel the story behind the death of Baroness Heloisa. Some of these clues lead to online Python notebooks. Participants must work through these notebooks to solve the mystery.

The activity consists of the following steps:

1. **Collecting clues**: Participants search the room for clues that give them information about Heloisa’s death. 
2. **CSUnplugged (frequency analysis)**: The collected clues refer to an unplugged activity. In this activity, participants learn how, by analyzing the frequencies of words in a text, they can identify the author of the text. If they complete this activity successfully, they obtain a four-digit code with which they can open a first box with clues.
3. **Authorship recognition notebook**: The box with clues contains Heloisa’s will and a number of letters that were sent to Heloisa by people from her circle. It also contains a reference to a Python notebook. Using this notebook, participants investigate who might be responsible for Heloisa’s death.
4. **CSUnplugged (ASCII)**: At the end of the notebook, participants receive a hint about how to open the next box. Using this hint, participants can carry out a second unplugged activity. The result of this activity is a code for the lock of the second box.
5. **Cipher notebook**: The second box again contains a number of letters. However, these are written in cipher. The box also contains a reference to a Python notebook with which participants can decipher the letters.
6. **The story**: Participants read the deciphered letters. This way, they learn how Heloisa met her end.

You can also present the material in this learning path in other ways. You can step away from the escape room principle by giving the connections, which participants would otherwise have to find themselves, in the form of hints.
