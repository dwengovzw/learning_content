# The seven bridges of Königsberg

The city of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) was part of the Prussian Empire. The Pregel River flows through Königsberg, with several branches that divide the city into two pieces of mainland and two islands. Below you see an image of Königsberg in 1652 that shows how the river flows.

There are seven bridges that connect the parts of the city. Can you see where the bridges are?

In 1736, the mathematician Leonhard Euler was asked whether there is a way to take a walk through the city such that you cross each bridge only once. 

**Assignment:** Try to draw a path yourself; is that possible?
