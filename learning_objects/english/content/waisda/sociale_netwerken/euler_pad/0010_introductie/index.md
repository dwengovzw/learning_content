# Let's draw!

Yes, this activity starts with a task!
- Take a sheet of paper and a ballpoint pen.
- Try to copy the following figures without lifting your pen.
- You may draw each line only once, so you may not go over the same line a second time.

**Tip:** Think about which points you should or should not start from in order to make the drawing.

**Tip:** Wanting to find the solution can be addictive. If after 15 minutes you still haven't found all the solutions, then continue with the learning path.
