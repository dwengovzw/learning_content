# Introduction

In the [learning path on recognizing emotions](https://dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=org-dwengo-waisda-beelden-emoties-herkennen&language=nl&te=true&source_page=%2Fwaisda%2F&source_title=%20wAIsda?#org-dwengo-waisda-beelden-emoties-herkennen-intro;nl;1) young people trained their first, simple neural network themselves. The result of that training process can be saved as a **'machine learning' model**. Such a model can be transferred to other computers.<br>
In this learning path young people learn how to **use an existing model and how to adapt it**. 

## Objective

In this activity the participants load a version of the ImageNet model. They add an extra layer to that model, which they then train to recognize their own images. 

## Competencies

* Participants learn how Google's Teachable Machine works.
* Participants use Teachable Machine to fine-tune a model to classify their own images.
* Participants learn what the concept of a 'model' is in *machine learning*.
* Participants realize that there is a difference between **training** a new AI model and **tuning** an existing model.
* Participants add a layer to an existing *machine learning* model. 
* Participants train the adapted model to classify their own images.
* Participants learn to solve problems as a team.
