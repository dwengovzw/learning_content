# Educational goals

The teaching materials in the learning path contribute to achieving the following educational goals.
These are the official formulations as published on [onderwijsdoelen.be](https://onderwijsdoelen.be/).

## 2nd grade

### Progression finality

##### Digital competencies
* 04.05 Students analyze the impact of digital systems on society based on principles of computational thinking.
##### Mathematics - natural sciences - technology - STEM
* 06.21 Students describe phenomena from reality using mathematical concepts from the second grade.
* 06.23 Students use ICT to perform calculations and create graphical representations.
* 06.53 Students analyze the interaction between sciences, technology, mathematics, and society on the basis of societal challenges.
##### Learning competencies
* 13.1 Students reflect cyclically and subject-specifically on their own learning process and adjust it purposefully on that basis.
