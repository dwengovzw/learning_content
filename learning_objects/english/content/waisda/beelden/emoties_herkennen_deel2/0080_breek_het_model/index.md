# Break the model

In part one of this activity, you trained an AI model that was able to recognize emotions. By now, you also know what layers the model is made of. In the next part of this learning path, you will try to break the existing model. So you're trying to make the model stop working properly. You can do that by removing layers from the model.

Using the following notebook, you can experiment with the model. You remove layers from the model and analyze the impact on the model's performance.
