# Educational objectives

The teaching material in the learning path contributes to achieving the following educational objectives.
These are the official formulations as published on [onderwijsdoelen.be](https://onderwijsdoelen.be/).

## 2nd stage

### Transfer finality

##### Digital competencies
* 04.05 The students analyze the impact of digital systems on society based on principles of computational thinking.
##### Social-relational competencies
* 05.01 The students interact with others respectfully and constructively, taking each other's boundaries into account.
##### Mathematics - natural sciences - technology - STEM
* 06.21 The students describe real-world phenomena using mathematical concepts from the second stage.
* 06.22 The students solve questions and problems by mathematizing and demathematizing and by making use of heuristics.
* 06.52 The students design a solution to a problem by applying science, technology, or mathematics in an integrated way.
##### Learning competencies
* 13.1 The students reflect cyclically and subject-specifically on their own learning process and adjust it purposefully on that basis.
* 13.3 The students use school and subject-specific language.
##### Entrepreneurship
* 15.02 The students generate creative ideas to solve a problem and discuss their feasibility based on criteria.

### Employment finality

##### Digital competencies
* 04.05 The students analyze the impact of digital systems on society based on principles of computational thinking.
