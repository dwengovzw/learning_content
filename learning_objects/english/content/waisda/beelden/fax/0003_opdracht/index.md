# Procedure

Divide the participants into groups of 5 to 7. Give each group two blank grids and two pencils. Each group has a division of roles:
* An 'artist' who makes a drawing on the blank grid.
* A 'printer' who later in the game reconstructs a drawing that was sent via the 'network'.
* Two assistants act as a 'modem' and help either the artist or the printer.
* The other young people will carry messages in the 'network'.

Bring the participants together by group and have each artist make a drawing. The drawing is made by coloring the desired squares on the blank grid. Use only one color for this.<br> Make sure the other groups do not see the drawing.

When the drawing is ready, ask each group to come up with a protocol: a way to represent a drawn figure by means of natural numbers, and how they will send these numbers one by one via the network from artist to printer. <br>
Sending is done by participants who walk from one side to the other. It is important to clearly explain what a natural number is and that only one number may be passed on at a time. In other words, one number corresponds to one trip, and the individual digits of these numbers may not be 'spelled out' separately!<br>
The aim is for the printer to be able to draw the artist's drawing without the printer having seen the drawing.

Collect the drawings now and arrange the groups as follows: Place the artists with their assistant on one side of the room. Place the printers together with their assistant on the other side of the room. The other children will walk back and forth between artist and printer.

You can see the layout of the room in the image.

Now distribute the drawings randomly among the artists, but make sure that no group gets its own drawing.

Then give the starting signal so the sending can begin!

When a group is finished, they hand in both drawings (the original and the print).
