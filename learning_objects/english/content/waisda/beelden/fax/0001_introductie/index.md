# Introduction

You yourself have probably sent a photo to a friend via the computer or your smartphone. But have you ever thought about how the computer represents these images?

Computers, smartphones, and other devices are connected to the internet via a modem and can thus communicate with each other. To ensure that these devices can 'understand' each other, that communication follows certain conventions: a protocol.

## Goal

In this activity, the participants devise their own protocol to send a drawing from one place to another.

## Knowledge and skills

* The participants learn how a digital image is composed of pixels that can be represented by numbers. 
* The participants learn to communicate purposefully about a problem. 
* The participants can devise and apply solutions to problems. 
* The participants learn to solve problems as a team. 
* The participants work with natural numbers.
