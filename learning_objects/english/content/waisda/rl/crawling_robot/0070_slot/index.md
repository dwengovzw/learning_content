# Summary

In this learning path you explored how reinforcement learning can be applied in robotics. You 3D-printed the parts of a robot and used the electronics from Dwengo's 'social robot' kit to build the robot. After that, you used your knowledge of physical computing to program the robot. Additionally, you considered how you could improve the robot’s learning process, relying on the knowledge you had already acquired about reinforcement learning.

If you would like to carry out more projects like this, have a look at [dwengo.org/physical_computing](https://www.dwengo.org/physical_computing) or [dwengo.org/waisda](https://www.dwengo.org/waisda).
