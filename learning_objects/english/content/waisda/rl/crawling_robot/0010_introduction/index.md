# Introduction

You now know the basic principles of reinforcement learning and can apply them to teach an AI agent a task. In this learning path, you apply that knowledge in the context of robotics. You will build a robot yourself and teach it to crawl. To do so, as with the worm, you use the Q-learning technique.

The crawling robot is a fully-fledged STEM project in which you combine skills in mechanics, electronics, programming, mathematics, and artificial intelligence. In this learning path, you will get explanations about the different components. Based on these explanations, you can build and program the robot. It will still take some effort to properly integrate all the elements. In addition, you will need to further test and optimize the robot yourself. So do not expect a ready-made step-by-step plan that will lead you to a working system without effort. You will have to think in a problem-solving way and iteratively improve the system until the robot works well. During the process, you will practice many complex skills such as computational and problem-solving thinking.
