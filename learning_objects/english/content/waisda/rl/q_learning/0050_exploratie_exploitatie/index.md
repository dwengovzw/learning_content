# Exploration and exploitation

You already know what the Q-table is and how we can adjust it with the update rule. The update rule tells you how to adjust the Q-table after taking an action and receiving the subsequent reward. What you don't yet know is which actions we should take to adapt the Q-table to the task we want to learn. The actions we choose must strike a balance between exploration and exploitation. 

## Exploration

Just like when you tried to play the Pong game yourself, it is necessary to try actions at random. This way, the system discovers which actions yield a high reward. We can add exploration to our learning process by occasionally taking not the best action but a random one. For example, two out of ten actions can be chosen at random.

## Exploitation

After a while, the system will discover which actions yield a higher reward. With exploitation, you use this knowledge to choose a good action. You do that by choosing the action that corresponds to the highest value in the Q-table. For example, eight out of ten actions can be the best action based on the values in the Q-table.
