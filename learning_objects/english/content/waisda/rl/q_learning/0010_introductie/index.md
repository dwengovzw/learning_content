# Introduction

You now know the basic principles on which a reinforcement learning system is built. In this learning path you will use that knowledge and train an agent using reinforcement learning for the first time. After completing this learning path, you will be able to answer the following questions:

* How can my *agent* learn an optimal *policy*?
* How can I adjust the *value function* to arrive at an optimal *policy*?
* How do I ensure that the *agent* both *explores* new possibilities and *exploits* already learned knowledge?
