# The principles of reinforcement learning (2)

Did it work? Did you manage to score more than 200 points? If you haven't succeeded yet, no worries, below we give some tips that can help increase your score.

**Tips**
- Remember that you can learn a lot by exploring. So don't be afraid to try things out.
- Just trying things at random can sometimes be overwhelming. Try to structure your tests by formulating a hypothesis and testing it. If your hypothesis is incorrect and doesn’t earn you any points, come up with another hypothesis.
- Look carefully at the information you receive. On the left of the screen you see two numbers. One goes up and down by itself. You can influence the other. What could be a possible way to score points?
- Don't give up too quickly! When you test a hypothesis, do it long enough to see what the effect is.
