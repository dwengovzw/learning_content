# How do we learn (solution)

The students looked for a solution to the challenge themselves. During that process they applied various techniques to arrive at a solution. Below we list a number of aspects of the solution process.

- **Exploration**: at the start the students know nothing about the challenge. They only see a grid with little shapes. Below the grid they see six buttons. By pressing the buttons they explore what the possibilities of the game are.
- **Exploitation** of the acquired knowledge: when the students discover what effect a button has on the game, they reuse this knowledge to arrive at a solution more easily. For example, when they want to move the empty circle to the left, they will know they need to press the red button. The accumulated knowledge is thus used to solve the problem.
- **Actions**: each button will influence the game in one way or another. Each button therefore has a corresponding action. During exploration students discover what these actions are. During exploitation they use the knowledge about the actions to influence the game deliberately.
- **Reward**: during exploration some buttons will have an effect on the game. The fact that our action causes something provides a reward in our brains. 
- The **state** of the game: at any moment the students see the full state of the game board. They see where the circles and squares are. By performing actions they can influence the state of the game.
- The **end goal**: the end goal of the task is not clear at the start. Only by exploring and using the knowledge gained (exploitation) can the goal be reached. The rewards that students receive along the way steer the problem-solving process so they can reach the goal without knowing exactly what the goal is.

It is not intended that the students can figure out all these aspects based on the challenge. The main idea is that they think about the strategies they used to arrive at a solution.
