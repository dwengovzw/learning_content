# Exploration and exploitation

As we mentioned earlier, in reinforcement learning we must find a balance between exploring and exploiting. 

## Exploration

During exploration you try out actions at random. That way you discover the effect of certain actions and what reward they yield. However, you cannot learn by only exploring, because then you would keep taking random actions. It is therefore important that you can also use the knowledge you gain through exploration to perform better. We call this exploitation of the acquired knowledge.

## Exploitation

By exploring you learn the outcome of certain actions. If an action has a good outcome in a certain state and therefore yields a higher long-term reward, you will want to take that action more often in that state in the future. In that case you exploit previously acquired knowledge. Note, however, that by relying too much on acquired knowledge and no longer exploring, you can get stuck in a suboptimal thought pattern. So it can be useful, even when you have already gained a lot of knowledge, to try a new action from time to time.
