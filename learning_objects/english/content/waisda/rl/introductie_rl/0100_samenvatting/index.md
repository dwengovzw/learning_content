# Summary

In this learning path you were introduced to the basic principles of reinforcement learning, also known as reinforcement learning. You know that a reinforcement learning system needs the following components: an **agent**, an **environment** with a **state**, **actions** that the agent can perform, a **reward** that depends on the **action** and the **state**, the **policy** that specifies which **actions** the **agent** will take and the **value function** that indicates how much **reward** an **action** will yield in the long term when applying a certain **policy**.

These are quite a few concepts. Some are easy to understand, such as the agent, the actions, and the reward. Other concepts, such as the policy and the value function, are harder to understand. Try to remember above all that the **policy** specifies **what the agent should do** and the value function says **how good that is**.

In this learning path you were always the **agent** who learned to perform a particular task. In the next learning path you will learn how to train an AI agent to perform a task.
