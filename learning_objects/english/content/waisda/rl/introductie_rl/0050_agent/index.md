# The agent

The term agent is a catch-all name for any "being" that can interact with the environment. In the game, you are the agent who learns how to play the game by experimenting. However, the agent can also be an AI system that learns to play the game. Below we list several examples of systems that we can label as an **agent**.

- A self-driving car: the car measures the state of the environment with sensors and responds, for example by stopping at a red light.
- A chess computer: the chess computer analyzes the position on the board (= the state of the environment), thinks of a next move and executes that move.
- A baby learning to walk: the baby will look for a place where they can pull themselves up (e.g., a chair) and will then use it to stand up.
- An animal looking for food: the animal will pick up the smell of the food with its nose and will then search for the food.
