# Welcome to the Learning Path!

Welcome to the STEM learning path on biomimicry. The learning path contains information students need, which you'll find in the white sections. The green sections provide additional information for teachers. In the final section 'In the Classroom,' you can find information about a possible lesson program, although this is only indicative.

Lessons based on this learning path can help to achieve the minimum goals related to STEM at school. The lesson content is now mainly aimed at students from the double and through-flow finalities, but it is also possible - with some adjustments and more guidance - to apply this learning path in the labor market-oriented finality. Especially the last part about the radar charts and the Pareto front will need to be adjusted.

Depending on the finality, the following minimum goals apply:
* Through-flow (D-finality): 6.44-6.46
* Double (D/A-finality): 6.25-6.27
* Labor market-finality (A-finality): 6.12

The learning path can be used in all study directions but seems particularly interesting for directions such as healthcare, orthopedic techniques, STEM disciplines, care-related studies, and sports courses.

If you would like to evaluate lessons based on this STEM project, several options are possible. Since this is mainly about problem-solving thinking, it is advisable to work with some sort of ‘portfolio’. This way, students can clearly show their progress. It is also possible to end with a poster fair or presentations in which students communicate their results more broadly. It is then advisable to vary between different groups by giving each group different criteria to compare with each other at the Pareto front.
