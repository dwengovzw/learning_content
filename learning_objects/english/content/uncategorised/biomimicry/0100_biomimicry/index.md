title: Did you ever twist your ankle?
version: 3

# Have you ever sprained your ankle?

Injury can sometimes happen quickly. A broken arm or leg, or a sprained ankle is a fairly common occurrence in emergency rooms. Each type of injury requires a specific treatment, but often the injury is resolved with a splint or cast. Which does not offer flexibility to the person's limbs. This extends the rehabilitation time by 25% for patients. However, that firmness is necessary to stabilize the region around the injury. Ideally, the other areas around the injury should have enough freedom of movement, which requires flexibility. Nowadays, there are more and more different types of 'orthoses' that try to take this into account. Orthoses is a collective term for an externally worn corrective device. The new orthoses are called smart orthoses; they try to combine multiple properties in multiple zones around the injury.

Did you sprain your foot or need support for your foot after surgery? For that, there are the so-called **ankle-foot orthoses**. They support your foot while walking. In this STEM project, we start from the problem statement that the current orthoses are 'too' firm. They fix the injury, but also all the areas around it. As mentioned before, it is important that the areas around it can move sufficiently. So we have to look for orthoses that are firm enough but at the same time offer flexibility where needed.
