# Criteria and Properties

Flexibility and sturdiness are just two criteria that determine the success of an orthosis. When designing a new product, many different criteria must be taken into account. Criteria about the material, the manufacturing process, criteria that are important for the patient, the caregivers…

> In this learning path, we use the terms **criterion** and **property**. A criterion is, for example, 'low price', while the property would then be '€50'.

There are a whole lot of criteria that apply to an orthosis to determine whether it is a ‘good’ or ‘bad’ orthosis.

## Exercise
Think for yourself what possible criteria might be for an ankle-foot orthosis.
What does an orthosis need to meet?!
