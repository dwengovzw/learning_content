# Seahorse as a solution

You notice that each ankle-foot orthosis has its own advantages and disadvantages. However, with all ankle-foot orthoses, the flexibility of the surrounding zones is insufficiently addressed. We need to find another system that is both flexible and strong at the same time.

To solve this problem, engineers are looking to nature, more specifically to the seahorse. The tail of the seahorse has the properties to be flexible in multiple directions, as it can move in several directions. Yet the tail is also very strong, researchers have shown that it can exert a tremendous amount of force. This is how seahorses protect themselves against predators. This strength and flexibility of the tail serve various purposes, and this actually applies to the entire skeleton of the seahorse. Strength for protection against predators and flexibility to be able to move and eat. The seahorse uses its flexible neck to eat. The neck can stretch out when food passes by. The seahorse clings with its tail to, for example, seagrass and then stretches out its neck to eat. This is called pivot feeding. The neck can stretch and retract, but it can move much less in the lateral directions. That's exactly what's interesting for an ankle-foot orthosis, the foot needs to be laterally fixed but should still be able to move in the so-called dorsal and plantar directions. Could there be a possibility to create a more flexible ankle-foot orthosis based on the skeleton of a seahorse?

> The above-described approach is what we call **'biomimicry'**. Here, researchers and engineers look to nature to solve an existing problem.

This is not a new concept, scientists have long been using nature as a source of inspiration. 
In reference works, you can also find other terms that are often used interchangeably; biomimetics, biomimics, bio-inspired-design. These often refer to 'subdisciplines'. For simplicity, we here only use the term 'biomimicry'.


# Examples of biomimicry

Before discussing our orthoses, we first look at some examples of biomimicry.

**Velcro** is perhaps the best-known example. Velcro was invented by Swiss engineer George De Mestral when he noticed how seeds and burrs from plants remained stuck in his dog's fur. He discovered that they all had small hooks at the end of the spines. It inspired De Mestral to get to work. Velcro was born.

Another example is the **Lotus effect**. The leaf of the lotus plant (Nelumbo nucifera) is water-repellent, the water droplets literally run off it. At that moment all sorts of dirt and dust particles are carried away by the water drops. The plant continuously cleans itself. Researchers are currently trying to apply this self-cleaning effect to various types of materials, for example, on that of medical equipment that needs to be sterile and remain sterile.

There are numerous examples, but it's not all about design. Recently, researchers thought about how trains could run more efficiently from point A to point B in the complex structure of a **train network**. They based this on an amoeba-like creature that continuously lets its protoplasm flow back and forth to move. The protoplasm must therefore be continuously transported to the other side of the creature depending on which direction it wants to move. The researchers made a computer algorithm of this to then apply it to the train service schedule.
