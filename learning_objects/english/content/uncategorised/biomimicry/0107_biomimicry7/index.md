# Comparison of Ankle-Foot Orthoses

There are already several ankle-foot orthoses on the market, each with their specific characteristics and therefore pros and cons. The seahorse-based ankle-foot orthosis is a new addition. Our problem is now solved: we have an ankle-foot orthosis that is flexible in the surrounding areas, yet can provide enough stability. Now we just need to determine which ankle-foot orthosis is the 'best'.
A choice must be made objectively, which is why we choose to compare the different types of orthoses based on criteria.

Below is a table with the different properties of the existing orthoses.

|                 | **Malleloc-L** | **ROM Walker** | **M-step** | **Stabili-tri** | **EXO-L** | **B2-foot** | **Seahorse orthosis** |
