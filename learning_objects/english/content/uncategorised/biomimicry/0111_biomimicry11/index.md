# How do you translate this into a STEM project with students?

In this final section, we briefly present some options for getting started with this STEM project in the classroom.
In the introduction for teachers, you already found information about minimum goals (end goals), fields of study, and possible evaluation tools. 

## Translation to the classroom
This STEM project starts from the premise that students are confronted with problems and also must solve them. It's therefore useful to translate this to classroom practice. This way, the problem statement can be reviewed and introduced in class. Students can then think about the problem in groups and discuss where possible solutions can be found, the concept of biomimicry can be introduced and guided in a classroom setting. The various single-foot orthoses can be taught directly, but there are also alternatives: through videos, through short questions... The students then get to work to create the radar charts, but first they must assign categorical values to 'tailored to the patient.' They should try to see for themselves that working categorically here can be more useful than assigning a score to each single-foot orthosis. Afterward, students cannot yet build the radar charts. Only 'price' is a score where higher is worse. While for other scores, a high value corresponds to a good property. So, students first need to invert the price. Then they need to normalize these values, something that is required for radar charts.

When the radar charts are created, students can get started on establishing a Pareto front. For this, they will also first need to invert the measurement, so that the Pareto front has a logical structure. Once the Pareto front is constructed, students can draw a conclusion. 
It's therefore advisable to start with a classroom introduction and guide the students well so that they understand the problem statement, context, and goal properly.

**After this, you can let students get to work, whether in groups or not. They will encounter the problem that the radar charts give a strange picture if they do not invert the price (and subsequently also do not normalize it). Let students make that mistake and work towards a solution themselves. Students should be able to solve this, actively encourage them to solve the problems they encounter.** 

It is also certainly possible to give the lessons a different interpretation. 

## Overview (possible) lessons

*Attention*: The possible structure of the lessons is slightly different from the learning path.

The overview as indicated in the table below is one possibility. As a teacher, you know your own students best and can better judge whether more or less time is needed for certain parts. Be sure to allow enough time to build the radar charts and the Pareto front, so that students have enough time to solve the problems they encounter.
