# Criteria: some criteria

The students have just come up with criteria, with or without your help, to which an ankle-foot orthosis must conform. There are quite a few, and you probably thought of more than are listed here.

* Price
* Speed of application
* Flexibility of extremity during fixation (material property)
* Firmness of extremity during fixation (material property)
* Complexity of applying fixation material (complete procedure vs just applying something, can anyone do it? Does it need a special environment?) Break it down!
* Procedure for applying fixation material
* Location of applying fixation material (medical environment – at home)
* Duration of fixation with certain material
* Pain/comfort of the patient during application
* Pain/comfort of the patient during fixation
* Removal of fixation material (simple vs difficult/complex)
* Benchmark materials
* Customized for the patient
* Adjustability and compatibility
* Stabilization of injury
* Hygiene of material / cleanability
* …

You can probably think of a few more yourself.
