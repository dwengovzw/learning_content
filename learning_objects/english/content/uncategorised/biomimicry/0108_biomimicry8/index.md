# Comparing Ankle-Foot Orthoses
We want to compare different ankle-foot orthoses with each other. We can do this with the help of a radar chart. A radar chart, also known as a spider chart, combines several parameters. We will now create a radar chart for each ankle-foot orthosis.
Students will create the radar charts themselves using the dataset below. Here is explained step by step how they can create these radar charts.

## Step 1: Complement the dataset: 'customized to the patient'

Below you can find a table with the different properties of the existing orthoses. This is also the dataset that the students receive.
