# Types of AI

## General AI, Narrow AI, and AGI

Although there are undoubtedly exciting developments in the field of AI, artificial intelligence is still far from reaching human intelligence. A human can learn a lot from a limited number of examples because they utilize their previously acquired knowledge and skills. Moreover, humans are very flexible: we are capable of quickly adapting to changing circumstances and responding adequately to unexpected events. Today, a computer cannot do that. An AI system is aimed at performing a **specific task** and is only good at what it was designed for.

    <strong>General AI, Narrow AI, and AGI</strong><br> 
    Narrow AI (<em>narrow AI</em>) refers to AI systems that perform the specific tasks they were designed for, e.g., a spam filter. <br>
    General AI (<em>general AI</em>) concerns systems that can handle a wider range of tasks, think for example of what one might imagine a robot butler would do. <br>
    With the so-called <em>Artificial General Intelligence</em> (AGI), it is about computer systems with the same capabilities as a human. We do not yet have the knowledge to design AGI systems.

AI was long at the level of narrow AI, but currently, some applications are situated between narrow and general AI.

## Knowledge and Data-Based Systems

To use AI for a particular problem, information about that problem is given to the computer. Then, the AI system processes this information and produces an *output*.

Such an AI system must first be developed by *programming algorithms* that contain expert knowledge or via learning algorithms (Steels et al., 2017):

- **Knowledge-based** (or rule-based) systems, which are programmed with rules. This involves attempting to cast as much of human expert knowledge as possible into rules.
- **Data-based** (or learning) systems, which are programmed with learning algorithms and are also referred to as *machine learning* systems. Statistical methods are used to detect patterns in relevant data and then used to solve new problems.

> The chatbot ELIZA and lexicon-based sentiment analysis are examples of knowledge-based systems. More explanation about this can be found in the teacher's guide of the project 'Chatbot', which is about language technology, specifically in the Chatbot and Sentiment Analysis chapters.

> Facial recognition on Facebook and Google Translate are data-based systems.

> In knowledge-based systems, the algorithm consists of explicitly programmed rules. One quickly runs into the limits of these systems. For an autonomous vehicle, for example, this would mean that one would have to know all possible scenarios.

Within the ML systems, you find the 'deep learning' systems.
