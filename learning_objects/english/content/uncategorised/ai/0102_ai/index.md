# Types of AI

## General AI, narrow AI, and AGI

There have undoubtedly been exciting developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). However, it is still a long way from reaching human intelligence. A human can learn a lot from a limited number of examples because they use previously acquired knowledge and skills. Humans are also very flexible: we are capable of quickly adapting to changing circumstances and responding adequately to unexpected events. A computer cannot yet do that. Each AI system is designed to perform a **specific task** and is only good at what it was designed for.

    <strong>General AI, narrow AI, and AGI</strong><br> 
    Narrow AI (<em>narrow AI</em>) is AI systems that perform specific tasks they were designed for, e.g., a spam filter. <br>
    General AI (<em>general AI</em>) is systems that can handle a wider range of tasks. A robot butler is one example of this type of AI. <br>
    <em>Artificial General Intelligence</em> (AGI) is the term used for computer systems with the same capabilities as a human. We do not yet have the knowledge to design AGI systems.

Narrow AI has been around for a long time, but we now have some applications that are sit between narrow and general AI.

## Knowledge and Data-Based Systems

To use AI for a particular problem, information about that problem is given to the computer. The AI system processes this information and produces an *output*.

An AI system like this must first be developed by *programming algorithms* that contain expert knowledge or via learning algorithms (Steels et al., 2017):

- **Knowledge-based** (or rule-based) systems are programmed with rules. This involves attempting to set out as much human expert knowledge as possible in the form of rules.
- **Data-based** (or learning) systems are programmed with learning algorithms and are also referred to as *machine learning* systems. Statistical methods are used to detect patterns in relevant data and then used to solve new problems.

> The chatbot ELIZA and lexicon-based sentiment analysis are examples of knowledge-based systems. More explanation about this can be found in the teacher's guide for the project 'Chatbot', which is about language technology, and particularly the Chatbot and Sentiment Analysis chapters.

> To distinguish between apples and pears, the knowledge-based approach could work as follows:<br>

> Facebook's facial recognition and Google Translate are both data-based systems.

> In knowledge-based systems, the algorithm consists of explicitly programmed rules. The limits of these systems quickly become apparent. For an autonomous vehicle, for example, this would mean knowing and specifying all possible scenarios.

Within ML systems, you will find 'deep learning' systems.
