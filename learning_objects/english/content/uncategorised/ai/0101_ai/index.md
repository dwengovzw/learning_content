# Intelligence

More than 2000 years ago, Socrates and Plato were already fascinated by human intelligence, but to date, there is still **no generally accepted definition of intelligence**. <br>
Some examples of how intelligence is defined (Legg & Hutter, 2007; Tegmark, 2017):

- “The ability to learn, to make estimates and to fantasize” (16th century, doctor and psychologist Huarte).
- “Intelligence is the global aptitude of an individual to act purposefully, to think rationally, and to deal effectively with their environment” (1958, psychologist Wechsler, the founder of the widely used IQ tests WAIS and WISC).
- “Intelligence is a very general mental capability that, among other things, includes the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, understand complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience” (1997, 52 experts).
- “Intellectual ability” (Van Dale).
- “The ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills” (Oxford English Dictionary).
- “Intelligence measures the ability of an agent to achieve goals in a wide range of environments” (2006, computer scientists Hutter and Legg). Such an agent could be, for example, a human or an animal, or an AI system.
- “Intelligence is the ability to achieve complex goals” (Tegmark, 2017).

The last two definitions include, because of their breadth, many characteristics: the ability to acquire knowledge, to adapt, to understand…

# Artificial intelligence

AI has already had successful applications: facial recognition in China to grant access to buildings, AI systems that match specialists in the diagnosis of skin cancer, AlphaGo Zero that taught itself Go just by playing against itself (Steels et al., 2017).

Defining artificial intelligence, something that is used in so many different domains, is no easy task. So apart from intelligence, there have already been **numerous definitions** given for AI:

- “Artificial intelligence refers to systems that exhibit intelligent behavior by analyzing their environment and acting – to a certain extent autonomously – to achieve specific objectives. AI-based systems can be purely software-based and active in the virtual world (for example, voice-driven assistants, software for image analysis, search engines, and systems for speech and facial recognition), but AI can also be integrated into hardware devices (for example, advanced robots, self-driving cars, drones, or applications of the internet of things)”, this is the definition used by the European Commission in 2018 (PwC, 2018).
- “Artificial intelligence is non-biological intelligence” (Tegmark, 2017).
- “AI refers to computers that do things that one would consider done by a mind. Some of these things (e.g., reasoning) are typically described as 'intelligent'. Others (e.g., seeing) not. But all require psychological skills that enable a human and an animal to achieve their goals, such as perception, association, prediction, planning, and controlling a motor” (Boden, 2016).
