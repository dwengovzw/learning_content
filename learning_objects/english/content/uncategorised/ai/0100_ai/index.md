# Ubiquitous
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is extensively covered in the media. Popular themes include: chatbots, self-driving cars, virtual assistants, privacy, and the loss of jobs. AI is increasingly entering our lives and is already leading to reforms in the service sector and industry.

Stanford professor Andrew Ng even calls AI the new electricity.

Indeed, AI has already been successful in applications: facial recognition in China to grant access to buildings, AI systems that rival specialists in the diagnosis of skin cancer, AlphaGo Zero that learned to play Go by playing against itself (Steels et al., 2017).

**New technologies change society, and some do so in a very profound way.** According to Gabriels (2019), "technological developments help shape the way we see the world and technology influences our thinking, behavior, and our values and norms."

The internet and the ubiquitous smartphone have a major impact on the labor market, our household, and leisure activities, in other words, on our everyday life. Communication applications and social media have changed the service provision of the government and companies. Online shopping, massively sharing photos, digital banking, looking up a recipe or a cheaper energy supplier on the internet, booking a hotel from your comfy chair... These matters are so well established that a life without them is almost unimaginable.

The **impact** of AI may be even greater than the arrival of the internet. AI is already present in **everyday life**: facial recognition on Facebook, Google Translate, asking questions to Siri, suggestions on Netflix, in insurance firms robots sort incoming emails, on bol.com a chatbot is at your disposal, spam filters, better navigation systems... <br>
However, AI has also penetrated the legal world, healthcare, and journalism. Education cannot escape it either; just think of learning analytics in education, and the use of ChatGPT.
