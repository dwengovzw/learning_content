# Ubiquitous
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been extensively covered in the media. Popular themes include: chatbots, self-driving cars, virtual assistants, privacy, and the loss of jobs. AI is increasingly entering our lives and is already leading to reforms in the service sector and other parts of industry.

Stanford professor Andrew Ng has even called AI the new electricity.

Several applications of AI have already been successful, including facial recognition in China to grant access to buildings, AI systems that rival specialists in the diagnosis of skin cancer, and AlphaGo Zero, which learned to play Go by playing against itself (Steels et al., 2017).

**New technologies change society, and some do so in a very profound way.** According to Gabriels (2019), "technological developments help shape the way we see the world and technology influences our thinking, behavior, and our values and norms."

The internet and the smartphone have had a major impact on the labor market, our household and leisure activities: in other words, our everyday life. Communication applications and social media have changed the service provided by both governments and companies. Online shopping, sharing of photos, digital banking, looking up a recipe or a cheaper energy supplier on the internet, booking a hotel from your armchair ... all these ways of using computers are so well established that a life without them is almost unimaginable.

The **impact** of AI may be even greater. AI is already present in **everyday life**: from facial recognition on Facebook, through Google Translate, Siri, Netflix's suggestions algorithm, chatbots, spam filters ans so in. Insurance firms even have robots sorting incoming emails. AI has also penetrated the legal world, healthcare, and journalism. Education cannot escape it either; just think of learning analytics in education, and the use of ChatGPT.
