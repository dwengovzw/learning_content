A data-driven AI system?
===============

The application "Should I go to the doctor" works based on rules that we as humans came up with. For some applications, however, it's too complex for humans to think up all the rules to solve a problem. Suppose, for example, that we want to detect tomatoes in images. How would we do that? We need to take into account how the computer represents images. Below you see an image of tomatoes. On it you see a small yellow square; in the grids next to the image we zoom in on that square. This shows that the image consists of three grids, one for each primary color (red, green, and blue). An element in that grid is called a pixel.
