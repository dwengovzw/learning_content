# Coloring Photos

A specific application of AI systems is coloring black-and-white images. In the following, you will explore how these systems are capable of automatically coloring photos.

## Exercise

The following photo was taken by Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii in the Russian Empire sometime between 1905 and 1915. Below you see three versions of the same photo. Two of the versions have been edited, one is the original. **Which photo do you think is the original?**

![Versie 2](img/image10.png)
![Versie 3](img/image1.jpg)

**Why did you choose one photo over the others?**

**Were you able to correctly identify the original?**

**Explanation**:
There are three photos here. <br>
- The first photo is the original image.
- The second photo was generated by an AI system that learned to color black-and-white photos. First, the colors were removed from the original, and then the algorithm was asked to color the black-and-white photo. <br>

- The last image was generated by reducing the saturation of the original image in Photoshop.
