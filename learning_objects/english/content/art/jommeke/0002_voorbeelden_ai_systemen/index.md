Shazam has learned to predict, based on short snippets of recorded audio, which song is playing.

#### TikTok

TikTok uses AI systems to predict which videos you will like. In this way they make sure you keep watching.

#### Virtually try out beauty products

The beauty industry is also harnessing the power of digital applications. Using an app on your smartphone, you can, for example, see whether a certain lipstick color suits you and virtually try nail polish on your own nails.

#### Google 

You have probably already used the search bar in Google. Artificial intelligence ensures that your search yields better results.<br>
While traveling, you can call on Google Translate when a language problem arises, and the application is even more user-friendly with Google Lens.

#### Snapchat

Snapchat uses AI systems for their filters and lenses ([Snapchat examples](https://www.snapchat.com/lens)).
You can also chat on Snapchat with the chatbot 'My AI', which is based on the technology behind ChatGPT.

#### Checking spelling and grammar in Microsoft Word

When you type a text in Word, you can use Microsoft Editor to check whether you have spelled the words correctly. You can also get suggestions regarding punctuation and the style of your text. 

#### Netflix

Your experiences on Netflix are personalized. Algorithms recommend certain films and series to you based on previously watched items.
