An AI system?
===============
To understand what an AI system is, you first need to understand the limitations of systems/computer programs that do not use AI. A traditional computer program follows a set of predetermined rules (= an algorithm) to achieve a goal. You can compare it to a recipe in a cookbook: the recipe sets out the rules for making a dish. 

However, there are problems for which it is very difficult or impossible to formulate these rules (the algorithm). For example, recognizing a face in a photo or deciding what action you should take in a particular traffic situation. AI systems improve on these classic systems because they are able to learn the rules themselves based on examples.  

Because AI systems can learn rules on their own, they are able to perform tasks that were previously only possible for humans. That is why the European Parliament defines AI systems as follows:

> AI is the ability of a machine to display human-like skills - such as reasoning, learning, planning, and creativity. <div style="text-align: right">Source: [European Parliament](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/nl/headlines/society/20200827STO85804/wat-is-artificiele-intelligentie-en-hoe-wordt-het-gebruikt#:~:text=AI%20is%20de%20mogelijkheid%20van,%2C%20leren%2C%20plannen%20en%20creativiteit.&text=AI%2Dsystemen%20zijn%20in%20staat,analyseren%20en%20autonoom%20te%20werken)</div>
