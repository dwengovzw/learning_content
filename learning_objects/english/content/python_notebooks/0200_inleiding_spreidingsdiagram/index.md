# Introduction

Working with scatter plots is one of the learning objectives of the second grade. In this series of notebooks, you will learn how to create a scatter plot of a dataset with two variables in Python. You will plot the data in a coordinate system, the result is a cloud of points or scatter plot. This can be data that you type in yourself or data that you upload from a file. 
With two other notebooks, you can practice what you learned. The importance of visualization is clarified in yet another two notebooks.

This learning path also forms the basis for all learning paths in which you draw graphs. The notebooks also include which concepts of computational thinking and which principles of programming are covered.
