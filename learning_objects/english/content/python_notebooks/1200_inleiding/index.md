# Introduction
## Description
The COVID-19 pandemic grips the entire world.
To control the impact of the virus, one can use the principle of social exclusion or focus on group immunity.
In this project, students can simulate an epidemic through a social network, and investigate which strategies can best keep the epidemic in check.
In the reporting of the COVID-19 pandemic, terms such as 'mathematical model' and 'exponential growth' are often mentioned. In this learning path, you will engage with the data and exponential functions and learn how a mathematical model for an epidemic is developed.

## Infectious Diseases
Nothing has killed as many humans in the history of mankind as infectious diseases.
The disease that has killed the most people is likely tuberculosis, which claimed 1 billion people in just the 19th and 20th centuries.
The disease that has killed the fastest is the Spanish flu epidemic that killed 50 to 100 million people between 1918 and 1920. The disease with the largest proportional mortality rate seems to be the Black Death, which killed 20% of the world's population and even 50% of the European population in the 14th century. Even more deaths were counted on the American continent after European colonization. It is estimated that 90% of the indigenous population was eliminated by diseases brought by Europeans. The native population had never before come into contact with these diseases and thus had not had the opportunity to develop resistance to them.

Today, infectious diseases cause fewer deaths due to better medical knowledge, techniques, and resources. However, they remain a serious problem for public health, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, individuals can easily spread diseases. For instance, a disease can travel to another continent via airplane in just a few hours.
