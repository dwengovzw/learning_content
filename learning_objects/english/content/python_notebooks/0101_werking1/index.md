# Working with notebooks

The instructional material of 'Python in mathematics and STEM' is provided in the form of interactive **_notebooks_**. Notebooks are _digital documents_ that contain executable code as well as text, images, video, hyperlinks ... 

_New concepts_ are introduced through textual explanation, video, and images.

There are elaborated *examples* along with both small and large *assignments*. In these assignments, you will be able to run provided code, but also write your own code.

The code used in the notebooks is Python version 3. We chose Python because it is a very accessible programming language, which is often also intuitive.  
Python is also on the rise and is used by companies, such as Google, NASA, Netflix, Uber, AstraZeneca, Barco, Instagram, and YouTube.

We chose notebooks because there are several important advantages: teachers do not have to do advanced installations to use the notebooks, teachers can offer different types of instructional content through one platform, the notebooks are interactive, students build the solution to a problem step by step in the notebook making that process visible to the teacher ([Jeroen Van der Hooft, 2023](https://libstore.ugent.be/fulltxt/RUG01/003/151/437/RUG01-003151437_2023_0001_AC.pdf)).

If you click the 'Open notebooks' button below, you will be redirected to another website where your personal notebooks will be loaded. (This may take a while).

You will find (on the Files tab) two files with extension .ipynb. These are the two notebooks that respectively give you an overview of the structure and possibilities and how to get started. In these first two notebooks, you will learn how the notebooks are conceived and how to get started with them.

After going through both notebooks, you will have a good idea of how our Python notebooks are conceived.
