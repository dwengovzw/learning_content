# Introduction

When researchers start working with texts on social media, they often look for information that is explicit and implicit in those texts. The rise of social media and the fact that posts are filled with sentiment and opinions have spontaneously given birth to the scientific discipline of sentiment analysis. After all, social media posts are primarily meant to share opinions and impressions. Thoroughly analyzing social media is thus impossible without sentiment analysis.
Computers are used to search for feelings and opinions, usually in content such as customer reviews, tweets, and blogs, mainly on social media.

In addition to explicit opinions and feelings, information that is not literally in a text can also be extracted. Is a customer satisfied with a certain product? Does the author of a tweet agree with a certain political stance?

In human relationships and activities, opinions play an important role, hence the wide application area of sentiment analysis: health, tourism, hospitality, retail, social events, financial services, political elections... By focusing on sentiment analysis, efforts are made to, for example, create a ranking of products, estimate the success of a movie, predict an election result, or forecast stock market trends.

Automatic sentiment analysis is done with an artificial intelligence system. Such an AI system is developed by programming algorithms which contain expert knowledge (knowledge-based systems) or through learning algorithms (data-based systems).
For more explanation, you can refer to chapter 1 of [chatbot](embed/Chatbot_handleiding_eerstedruk.pdf "chatbot manual").

You will be working with notebooks for the automatic detection of the sentiment of online reviews. To be able to do this, you first get to know the techniques used in several preparatory notebooks. Fundamental concepts of machine learning are covered in sentiment analysis.
