# Grayscale Images

A grayscale image for a computer is nothing but a grid of numbers.

    <figcaption align = "center">A three from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset comprises 70,000 images of handwritten digits, each 28 x 28 pixels in grayscale.</figcaption>

To become familiar with this, you can work through two notebooks.

The first notebook reveals how digital images in grayscale are constructed and how the computer interprets them.<br>
The second notebook shows how you can manipulate an image by performing operations on the grid.

#### Assignment

Within the context of the media literacy minimum objective from the second grade, **“The impact of digital systems”**

Some possible lines of thought:<br>

* Do you understand how photos can be manipulated?
* Can you make the link to fake news?
* How can you improve photos? For example, how can you make them darker or lighter?
* What could this mean for the job of a photographer or designer?
* What you learned in the notebook fits within the digital representation of information. Explain this.

#### Link with mathematics minimum objectives

In mathematics, such a grid is called a **matrix**.
