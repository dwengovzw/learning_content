# Applying the Pythagorean Theorem

The exercises on the Pythagorean theorem in the third grade are often reducible to the same problem: 2 sides of a triangle are known and the third side must be calculated.

There are two types you can distinguish:
* either the 2 legs of the triangle are given and the hypotenuse must be calculated;
* or 1 leg of the triangle and the hypotenuse are given and the other leg must be calculated.

If you have previously tackled both types, then recognizing which of these two types you are dealing with leads directly to the solution of the problem. You just need to adjust the previously developed solution to the new situation.

---

In these notebooks, you will leave the necessary *calculations to the computer*. This allows you to fully focus on the problems at hand.

These two types of problems can already be found in the first notebook. To solve them, two *functions* that you will define yourself in Python are sufficient. After solving the basic problems, you will tackle the other problems using *pattern recognition* by adapting the code from the previously solved problems.

In a second notebook, you will find additional challenging exercises. For example, you will use a *choice structure* and work with the *distance between two points*.

<div class="alert alert-box alert-secondary">
    The last exercise in the second notebook concerns the following:
<ul><li> The Pythagorean theorem states:<br>if a triangle is right-angled, then the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the legs.</li></ul>
<ul><li> According to the law of <em>contraposition</em> in logic, it follows that:<br>
if the square of the hypotenuse is not equal to the sum of the squares of the legs, then the triangle is not right-angled. </li></ul>
<ul><li> Using the cosine rule (in any triangle), you can also prove the converse of the Pythagorean theorem. That is:<br>
if the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the legs, then the triangle is right-angled. </li></ul>

So, depending on which material has already been covered, the result printed in this exercise may vary.
