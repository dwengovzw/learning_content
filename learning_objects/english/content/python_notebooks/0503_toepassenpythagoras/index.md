# Applying the Pythagorean Theorem

The exercises on the Pythagorean theorem in the third grade are often reducible to the same problem: 2 sides of a triangle are known and the third side must be calculated.

There are two types you can distinguish:
* either the 2 legs of the triangle are given and the hypotenuse must be calculated;
* or 1 leg of the triangle and the hypotenuse are given and the other leg must be calculated.

If you have previously tackled both types, then recognizing which of these two types you are dealing with leads directly to the solution of the problem. You just need to adjust the previously developed solution to the new situation.
