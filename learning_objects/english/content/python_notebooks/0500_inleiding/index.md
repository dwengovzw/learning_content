# Introduction
In the third year of secondary education, the Pythagorean theorem is introduced. The exercises that come with it are well-suited to apply several concepts from computational thinking and programming: input-processing-output, pattern recognition, functions...

What is given about the sides of the triangles can be requested from the user. Using code, this _input_ can then be automatically _processed_ and followed by an _output_ that is displayed.

The number of types of exercises involving the Pythagorean theorem in the third year of secondary education is quite limited. Therefore, the code needed in the exercises is often the same. It is therefore useful to capture that code in a _function_ which can then be reused in different exercises. Moreover, working with functions makes the programs more readable.
Recognizing which type of _problem_ needs to be solved falls under _pattern recognition_.
