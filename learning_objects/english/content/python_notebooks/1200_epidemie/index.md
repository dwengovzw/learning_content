# Infectious Diseases

Throughout the history of mankind, nothing has killed as many people as infectious diseases. 
The disease that has killed the most people is probably tuberculosis, which claimed 1 billion lives in the 19th and 20th century alone. 
The disease that killed the fastest is the Spanish Flu epidemic that killed between 50 to 100 million people between 1918 and 1920. The disease with the largest proportion of deaths was the Black Death, which killed 20% of the world's population and even 50% of Europe's population in the 14th century. Even worse than that disaster was the death toll on the American continent after the European colonization. It is estimated that 90% of the native population was wiped out by diseases brought by Europeans. The native population had never encountered these diseases before and therefore had not had the chance to develop resistance to them.

Today, infectious diseases cause fewer deaths due to better medical knowledge, techniques, and resources. However, they remain a serious public health problem, as evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, individuals can easily spread diseases. For example, a disease can spread to another continent in just a few hours by airplane.
