# Working with notebooks

**Saving the Notebook**

You can download the notebook as an **.ipynb** file to continue working on it later. To do this, go to **File > Download**.
Afterwards, you can find the notebook in your computer’s **Downloads** folder. You can then move it to a folder where it is easy to find.

You can also save the (executed) notebook as a **PDF** via your browser. For example, in Chrome: **Print > Save as PDF**. It is recommended to set the **Scale** to 85 percent.

**Note: You do not need to log out, but you may if you want. The logout button can be found in the menu under File, at the very bottom.**
*Previously, when you had completed a series of notebooks, you had to log out in the tab with the notebook group. This is no longer necessary.*
