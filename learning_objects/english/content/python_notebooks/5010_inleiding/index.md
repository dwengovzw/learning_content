# Introduction

In 1980, the book 'Mindstorms' by Seymour Papert was published. He extensively described the possibilities that the computer offers to make theoretical things concrete, to experiment, and to think systematically. Papert did this concretely by having students program a 'turtle' that moves across the screen.<br>
In his book, he incidentally used the term 'computational thinking', referring to everyday life. Papert is thus one of the pioneers of computational thinking.
