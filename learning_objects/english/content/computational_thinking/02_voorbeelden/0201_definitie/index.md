# Review of the definition and basic concepts

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
    <strong><h5>A definition of computational thinking</h5></strong> 
    <em>Computational thinking is a methodology for tackling a complex problem in such a way that a computer could be used to solve it.</em><br>
    <br>
    <strong><h5>Four basic concepts</h5></strong>
    Computational thinking relies on <strong>four basic concepts</strong>:<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Decomposition</strong><br>
    Carefully splitting a problem into well-chosen subproblems so that each part can be addressed separately, making it easier to obtain a solution to the problem.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Abstraction</strong><br>
    Ignoring information that is not needed to solve a problem. Hiding certain details to be able to think about a problem in broad terms.<br> 
    When tackling complex problems, abstraction is needed because reasoning proceeds more smoothly without the burden of irrelevant details. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Pattern recognition</strong><br> 
    Discovering that certain aspects of a problem exhibit similarities, allowing it to be simplified.<br> 
    Recognizing that a problem bears similarities to a previously solved problem. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Algorithmic thinking</strong><br> 
    Making explicit a sequence of unambiguous instructions that must be carried out step by step.<br> 
    Realizing that this sequence of instructions and their order are essential to produce the desired result.
