# Computational thinking and acting

Internationally, there is no consensus on a definition of computational thinking, although there is on some basic concepts. You can read more about this in the learning path ['Definition and points of attention'](https://www.dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=ct2_concreet&language=nl&te=true&source_page=%2Fcomputational_thinking%2F&source_title=%20Computationeel%20Denken#ct_inleiding1;nl;3). 

The concepts and practices of computational thinking are not perceived in the same way by everyone. But for Flemish education, it is especially useful to know which ones appear in the attainment targets, minimum objectives, and curricula. After all, you want to know **which ones you definitely have to address in your lessons.** <br>
The attainment targets and minimum objectives go beyond the four basic concepts of computational thinking. They aim for a basic knowledge of computer science. After all, it is also about computational action. You can read more about this in the learning path ['Attainment targets and minimum objectives'](https://www.dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=ct8_eindtermen&language=nl&te=true&source_page=%2Fcomputational_thinking%2F&source_title=%20Computationeel%20denken#ct06_00;nl;3).

We have compared several researchers' frameworks against the Flemish attainment targets and minimum objectives.
Two researchers' frameworks showed a lot of overlap with them and can therefore provide inspiration on the concepts and practices of computational thinking that can be addressed in your lessons.

## Generally applicable overview

Instead of looking at where there is consensus, you can also examine which aspects of computational thinking are mentioned.<br>Michael Lodi (2020) took this different approach and arrived at the following: 

**Overview of thought processes, activities and approaches**:

|**Thinking processes**|**Methods / activities**|**Practices / approaches**|
