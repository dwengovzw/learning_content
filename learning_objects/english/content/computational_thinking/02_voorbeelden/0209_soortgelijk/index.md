# Example from the literature: PRADA
 
Sands et al. (2018) indicated that professional development on computational thinking for you, as a teacher, can only be successful if<br>
- it is related to the course content you teach;
- it demonstrates how computational thinking can be integrated into the existing curriculum and subject-specific lessons;
- and that it does so in a way that also fits your teaching methods.

Dong et al. (2019) were inspired by this and developed the PRADA model - PRADA stands for *Pattern Recognition, Abstraction, Decomposition, and Algorithms*. They brought their model to teachers of mathematics, science, social studies, and English linguistics and found that **this model encourages teachers to make connections between computational thinking and their own teaching materials**. 

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
The study by Dong et al. showed that interdisciplinary teacher teams are capable of "mixing and matching" the core concepts of computational thinking across different domains. <strong>They thus refute the idea that some domains would not allow engagement with computational thinking.</strong>
</div>

PRADA focuses on the same core concepts of computational thinking as we do. After all, like us, Dong et al. want to teach teachers "to recognize concepts of computational thinking in their domain, and to provide them with examples of how they can bring the concepts into their lessons." They also aim for teachers to be able to prepare such lessons on their own.

### A few examples from the work of Dong et al.

The **first example** is situated in the **history class**. An interdisciplinary group of high school teachers designed a historical puzzle game: through puzzles and quizzes, students explore life in the Middle Ages. They have the students program the game in Snap!, a Scratch-like programming environment.

**Lesson objective:** getting to know life in the Middle Ages

The **second example** comes from a **science lesson**. Teachers designed a quiz to review and practice the material covered on the rock cycle. The students must program that quiz in Snap! The students also carry out a lab in which they investigate various properties of rocks and check their conclusions using the program.

The **third example** is intended to practice for standardized tests in the context of the **subject of mathematics**. The teachers have programmed a test in Snap!, and the students take the test in teams using the program. Each question corresponds to a certain distance. With a correct answer the team moves forward by that distance; with an incorrect answer the team is penalized.
