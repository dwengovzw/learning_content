# Basic concepts of computational thinking in the Bebras contest

The main goal of the international Bebras contest is to get participants excited about computer science. During the contest, participants tackle various problems that are linked to concepts from computer science. In doing so, participants’ **computational and problem-solving thinking** is also tested.

In the learning path ['Bebras'](https://www.dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=ct10_bebras&language=nl&te=true&source_page=%2Fcomputational_thinking%2F&source_title=%20Computationeel%20Denken#ct_10_0;nl;3) the basic concepts of computational thinking are clarified by discussing several questions from the Bebras contest and their solutions.

There you will find a number of questions from the Bebras contest, each accompanied by a description of which basic concepts of computational thinking you use to arrive at the solution to the given problem.
