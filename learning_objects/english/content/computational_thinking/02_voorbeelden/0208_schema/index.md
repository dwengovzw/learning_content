# Schema of computational thinking concepts

We present a schema that serves as a guide for you, as a teacher, when preparing your lessons on computational thinking concepts.

![Basic concepts schema](embed/schema.png "Basic concepts schema CT")

When completing the schema, you start from the basic concepts, but other concepts and practices of computational thinking will naturally emerge as well.<br>
Not all fields must be filled in. For example, programming does not always have to be covered. Even a computer is not always necessary. 

<div class="alert alert-box alert-danger">
Note: never working with a computer in any assignment is not an option either.  
</div>

In the learning path ['Cases'](https://www.dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=ct6_cases&language=nl&te=true&source_page=%2Fcomputational_thinking%2F&source_title=%20Computationeel%20Denken#ct_cases0;nl;3) you will find many classroom examples that were developed using this schema. <br>
In the next learning object we provide an example from the literature.
