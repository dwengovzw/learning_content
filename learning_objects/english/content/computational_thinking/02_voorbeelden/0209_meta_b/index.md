<context>
**Problem Statement**<br>
    - The students program a quiz to review and practice the rock cycle in Snap! 
    - The students conduct a lab in which they investigate various properties of rocks and check their conclusions using the program.
</context>
<decomposition>
**Decomposition**
- Students must "determine the composition of minerals based on density, hardness, and strength" (science). 
- Students "revise parts of the already written code for an overview game in Snap! by replacing lines of code with other questions" (coding).
</decomposition>
<patternRecognition>
**Pattern Recognition**<br>
- Students must "recognize the composition of rocks throughout the entire rock cycle" (science).
- Students "recognize **patterns** in the Snap! program and how to build loops" (programming).
</patternRecognition>
<abstraction>

</abstraction>
<algorithms>
**Algorithmic Thinking**<br>
Students "complete sorting activities in the program" (coding).
</algorithms>
<implementation>
**Program** in Snap!
</implementation>
