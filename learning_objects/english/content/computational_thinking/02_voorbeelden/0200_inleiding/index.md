# Introduction

In the learning path ['Definition and points of attention'](https://www.dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=ct2_concreet&language=nl&te=true&source_page=%2Fcomputational_thinking%2F&source_title=%20Computationeel%20Denken#ct01_01;nl;3) you were introduced to a workable definition of computational thinking. You also received further explanation of what the basic concepts actually entail. The following learning object summarizes this once again. However, computational thinking is not limited to the basic concepts. It covers much more, as was already shown by [the poster from *Barefoot Computing*](https://www.dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=ct2_concreet&language=nl&te=true&source_page=%2Fcomputational_thinking%2F&source_title=%20Computationeel%20denken#ct01_06;nl;3). 

The Flemish attainment targets and minimum goals therefore also refer to 'computational thinking and acting'.

In this learning path you will become acquainted with other concepts and practices, and we have collected examples of how **computational thinking and acting** can be addressed in your lessons. These are examples from both the literature and our own teaching materials. <br>

**These examples are not limited to the STEM domain;** human sciences are also addressed.
