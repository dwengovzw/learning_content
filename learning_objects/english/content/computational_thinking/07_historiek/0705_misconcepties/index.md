# Misconceptions

Sometimes misconceptions arise: people dream that 
* computers will be able to perform all tasks and solve all problems; 
* that by learning to program one will be able to tackle all problems; 
* that one can think computationally without any grasp of the technical side of computers and the possibilities and limitations that go along with it. 

The following facts show that such wishes are not realistic. 
* Decades ago, Alan Turing already showed that there were problems about which a computer could not give a definitive answer. 

> It has been proven that for the so-called 'Halting problem' (or 'Stop problem') there exists no algorithm to solve it: Suppose a computer program and an input value are given. Determine whether the program with that input stops after a finite number of steps or not. 

* There are tasks that a computer could theoretically perform, but that in practice can never be carried out because the computation time would be far too long. The mere fact that one has found an algorithm to tackle a problem does not mean one will actually reach the solution. For the so-called traveling salesman problem, for example, the algorithm consists of going through all possibilities one by one. If there are too many possibilities, it takes far too long to find a solution. One must therefore wait for a more efficient algorithm, but it is not certain that such an algorithm exists. What one then does is use an algorithm that does yield a good result, but for which one cannot be certain that it is the best solution. 

> Traveling Salesman Problem: Given a number of cities and the distances between them. Find the shortest route that visits each city once and ends at the first city. 

* Complex societal problems such as climate change cannot be solved by a computer. The computer can, however, be used to better understand different aspects of the problems, for example by visualizing data, modeling subproblems, and simulating possible solutions. 

* Programming can help to arrive at a solution to a particular problem more quickly. But programming takes practice, and devising a solution to a problem is not possible without knowledge of the domain in which the problem is situated. 

* Some technical knowledge of the computer is indispensable for computational thinking. Knowing enough about the technical side is necessary to assess when a computer can be used. The hardware of the computer system at one’s disposal has its limits: the amount of memory, the speed of the processor ... and one must take those into account. A defective hardware component can cause a computer program to not function properly. Besides the hardware, the software also matters: for example, to visualize data appropriate software must be installed on the device (Denning & Tedre, 2019). When devising solutions to new problems, one sometimes discovers that the systems available are inadequate, and then new systems have to be invented (Aho, 2011).
