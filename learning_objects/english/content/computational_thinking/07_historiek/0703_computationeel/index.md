# Computational thinking

Computational thinking is thus grounded in mathematical, logical, and algorithmic thinking, combined with insights from the natural sciences, technology, and engineering. It therefore also shows similarities with ‘other’ ways of thinking (Denning & Tedre, 2019; Barr & Stephenson, 2011; Selby & Woollard, 2013). 
Moreover, **the content of the term changes** along with developments in computer science, that is, with ‘what modern computers can do’ and the further digitization of society (Denning & Tedre, 2019). The internet, e.g., also influences what computational thinking entails: large amounts of data, cloud computing, smartphones, an unprecedented number of users ...

> What modern computers can do changes constantly, meaning that the problems that can be solved with computers also change. What was previously unthinkable to tackle with computers can suddenly come within reach. At the same time, new aspects are continually being added to the domain of computational thinking.

Although computational thinking does not have its origins in computer science, it is an **essential practice for a computer scientist** (see learning object on the ‘Great Principles’).

<strong><h5>Not only for computer science!</h5></strong>
However, computational thinking is <strong>not reserved for computer scientists</strong> alone. <br>
Computers have changed scientific research, both the natural sciences and the humanities.<br>
Moreover, the computer is used by a great many people in addition to computer scientists and other scientists. In almost every profession nowadays, a computer is involved. In leisure time too, the computer is present, for services, social media, and entertainment.

Almost every mathematical or scientific domain has a computational counterpart:

* Historians use Natural Language Processing to research the authors of old texts. 
* Lawyers use algorithms to quickly search through documents. 
* Art restorers reveal secrets embedded in paintings. 
* Climate scientists model climate change and simulate different  scenarios for global warming. 
* Realistic images in games and animated films are made possible by increasingly sophisticated computer techniques.
* Archaeologists search digital scans of the landscape for traces of archaeological objects, such as burial mounds and prehistoric field systems, or rely on an algorithm to determine the sex of a human skeleton more accurately and quickly. 

> Bioinformatics and histoinformatics are two examples of disciplines that have emerged from this.<br>

Awareness is beginning to grow among scientists from various fields that, with the help of computers, they can investigate things that previously could not be carried out, such as research based on very large datasets and the modeling and simulation of phenomena in the natural sciences.

Moreover, the computer is also used by a great many people in addition to computer scientists and other scientists (Lowe & Brophy, 2017). 

* Computational thinking is also applied in domains such as the legal field. 
* Physicians use chatbots for the medical history intake. Thanks to software, architects walk virtually through the buildings they design, even before they are built.
