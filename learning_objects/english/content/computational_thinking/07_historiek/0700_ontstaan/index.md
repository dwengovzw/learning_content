# Origins

The following video introduces how computational thinking became what it is today.  

![](@youtube/https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kli1fKCSl1s "introductory video to the basic concepts of computational thinking") 

When performing monotonous, repetitive tasks, people make mistakes due to distraction. Calculation errors therefore cannot be ruled out in calculations performed by hand. People thus started thinking about ways to counter this. <br>
For thousands of years, people have been looking for methods to avoid ‘human error’ wherever possible. They devised _**systems**_ that could prevent mistakes, designed _**tools**_ for calculation, and considered _**machines**_ that could perform specific tasks.

As early as antiquity, Babylonian mathematicians formulated **algorithms** to solve certain types of geometric problems (Burton, 1991). The ancient Greeks also designed algorithms, such as Euclid’s algorithm to determine the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers and the Sieve of Eratosthenes to identify prime numbers. The algorithms made mathematical methods accessible to people who were less skilled at calculation. 

> An algorithm translates a mathematical line of reasoning into a step-by-step plan.

The Salamis counting board (from 300 BC) is an example of a tool for calculation. It is a large marble tablet (1.49 m x 0.75 m x 4.5 cm) and is the predecessor of the **abacus**. An abacus that has existed for a very long time but is still widely used is the Chinese abacus. The position of the beads on an abacus determines a number. One can thus ‘represent’ a number with it, and as long as the beads stay where they are, the number is ‘preserved’ (Riley & Hunt, 2014). 

> ‘Memory’ and ‘representation’ already present in an abacus are concepts that reappear in modern computers. 

Later, people also devised tools such as the slide rule and logarithm tables. The first calculating devices did not appear until the 17th century, and they could really only add and subtract. 

In the 17th century, Blaise Pascal built a **calculating device** to add and subtract (it would take until the first half of the 20th century before calculators came on the market that were capable of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing). Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz improved Pascal’s device so that multiplication could be performed by repeating the same addition the correct number of times (Denning & Tedre, 2019; Riley & Hunt, 2014). 

> The Pascaline was a mechanical calculating device that could not be programmed. The first machine that could be programmed was a 19th-century loom (Riley & Hunt, 2014). 

Apart from calculation, but also to avoid errors and increase speed, industry introduced **Fordism**, working on the assembly line, in the early 20th century. Something similar was also applied to perform long calculations. Before the computer era, calculations for, for example, scientists or the military, were done by ‘human computers’, often women. Within these **teams** they followed certain **procedures** and **divided the tasks**; the results of one computer were passed on to another calculator who first performed an intermediate check (Denning & Tedre, 2019). 

> The experiences gained in preventing errors, e.g., by working sequentially in a team, were later adapted in the context of programming computers.

<strong><h5>Origin of computational thinking</h5></strong>
The desire to calculate faster and better, and to automate things, led to the emergence of the modern computer. And along the way in that process, computational thinking, grounded in mathematical, logical, algorithmic, scientific, and technical thinking, grew into a way of thinking that complements other modes of thought. At present it is an essential domain within computer science.<br>
<br>
<strong>Creative thinking process</strong><br>
Thinking about how a team can best carry out calculations, thinking about the design of a tool, thinking about which tasks could be performed by a machine and how such machines could be realized, is nothing other than computational thinking. This creative thinking process and the desire to realize these ideas lead to new developments in technology.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, this led to the development of the modern computer (Denning & Tedre, 2019).
