# Robots and AI

Thinking about automation and artificial intelligence is as old as time. Homer (about 800 years before Christ) described automatic gates of heaven in the Iliad and artificially intelligent ships in the Odyssey. But these works also illustrate the centuries-old fascination with imitating animal and human behavior. Homer writes about the golden handmaidens of Hephaestus, who were essentially a kind of care robots, his automatic tripods that could serve the gods, as well as the golden and silver dogs that had to guard the palace of Alcinous and were immortal (Kalligeropoulos & Vasileiadou, 2008; Kline, 2004, 2009). 

> The word ‘automata ( αυτ ó µατα )’ comes from Homer; it appears in the Iliad and the Odyssey. It means ‘by itself’. Homer uses it to describe machines of Hephaestus that can move by themselves (Kalligeropoulos & Vasileiadou, 2008). 

Automation thus was not limited to the design of machines, but people also looked for ways to imitate animal and human behavior. Ismail Al-Jazari wrote a book in 1206 in which he described the impressive automata he designed, including a boat with four automatic musicians. Then there is the ‘humanoid robot’ that Leonardo da Vinci designed at the end of the 15th century (but presumably never built) and Jacques de Vaucanson’s 18th-century mechanical duck that simulated the digestion of food. The automata were an early precursor to today’s robots.

Also in the 18th century, the Mechanical Turk (see Figure 2.1) was meant to make people believe that a machine had been invented that could play chess; the Mechanical Turk turned out to be sheer fraud — there was a person inside — but it does illustrate the desire to imitate human thinking as well.

Today, this is reflected in the development of artificial intelligence (AI), including the search for AGI (artificial general intelligence). AI systems are already active in various domains, e.g., supporting a radiologist in assessing medical images.

<strong><h5>Objectivity</h5></strong>
There are therefore multiple drivers that lead to the development of artificially intelligent systems, such as the desire to automate certain processes and to imitate human behavior. <br> 
But there is another possible motivation for deploying (and developing) AI: when people make decisions, those are not always based on objective considerations. Letting an ostensibly objective device, such as a computer, make decisions thus seems like an attractive idea.
