# Conclusion

Computational thinking helps to understand how digital devices and digital applications work, but it is also about the thought process that leads to creating them. Thinking about how a team can best perform computations, thinking about the design of a tool, thinking about which tasks could be carried out by a machine and how such machines can be built, is nothing other than computational thinking. This creative thought process and the desire to be able to realize these ideas lead to new developments in technology.

The desire to calculate faster and better, and to automate things, has led to the emergence of the modern computer. And along the way in that process, computational thinking has grown from mathematical, logical, algorithmic, scientific, and technical thinking into a complementary way of thinking, alongside other ways of thinking. Computational thinking therefore shows similarities with ‘other’ ways of thinking (Denning & Tedre, 2019; Barr & Stephenson, 2011; Selby & Woollard, 2013). At present, it is an essential domain within computer science.<br> 
Over the centuries, automation was not limited to designing machines; people also tried to imitate animal and human behavior. Today this translates into the development of artificial intelligence.

Computational thinking is not only an activity within computer science and other sciences, but also within domains such as law and history. Scientists everywhere can, with the help of computers, investigate things that previously could not be done. Moreover, the computer is also used by a great many other people.
In this way, computational thinking has spontaneously expanded to include seeing where and how the computer can be deployed.

As the field of computer science continues to develop, computational thinking will evolve along with it (Aho, 2011; Denning & Tedre, 2019; Selby & Woollard, 2013).

However, not all problems will be solved by using a computer. There will always remain tasks that cannot be carried out by a computer. Sufficient technical knowledge is also indispensable in order to be able to think computationally.
