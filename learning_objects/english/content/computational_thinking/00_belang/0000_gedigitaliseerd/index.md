# The digitized world

<div class="alert alert-box alert-secondary">
    <strong>Class discussion</strong><br> 
    Is there an invention that has changed the world more than the computer (Riley & Hunt, 2014)? 
</div>

We live in a technological knowledge society, which is **changing rapidly** due to the ongoing developments in digitization, the unstoppable flow of information, and the rise of artificial intelligence.
 
The **digitization** of society has a huge **impact** on our lives. The computer is ubiquitous. Decision-making is increasingly automated by algorithms, most people don't leave the house without a smartphone, and many spend hours each day checking their social media.
Moreover, it is impossible to ban this influence from our lives. But **each of us does have a choice**: to undergo it, or to try to understand it and handle it in a conscious way. 

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
    <strong>Functioning in the digitized world</strong><br> 
   To understand the digitized world, being able to <em>use</em> digital applications is not sufficient. It is important that people can adopt a resilient and flexible stance toward new digital applications. <br>
   <br>
   <em>Computational thinking is a way of working to understand that digital world and to intervene in it.</em> <br>
   <br>
   By gaining insights into the concepts that underlie digitization, one can better assess the possibilities, limitations, and potential risks of these applications, which also removes the fear of technology. Being able to think computationally can ensure that one functions and participates better in the digitized society, and that one better understands the interplay between technological developments and developments in society. 
</div>

**Worldwide** there is growing attention to computational thinking, a way of thinking that underpins all digital applications. 

<div class="alert alert-box alert-secondary">
    <strong>Assignment for students. What digital systems do you have at home?</strong><br> 
    Determine which digital systems you use on an average day, for example from the moment you wake up until you arrive at school. 
</div>

<br>
In what follows it will become clear that there is an interaction between your proficiency in computational thinking and your knowledge of how digital systems work. You can only become proficient in computational thinking if you have a basic knowledge of how digital systems work. And you can only properly understand how digital systems work if you are sufficiently skilled in computational thinking.
