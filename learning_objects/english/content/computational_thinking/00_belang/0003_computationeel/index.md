# Computational thinking is not new

What does computational thinking entail? The term is fairly new — ‘computational thinking’ first appeared in an educational context in 1980, in Seymour Papert’s book ‘Mindstorms’ — and is not always familiar to teachers. 

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
    It is often mistakenly thought that the term covers a completely new body of subject matter, whereas the concepts of computational thinking actually go back a long way, to a time when computers did not yet exist. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Many aspects of computational thinking have long been part of everyday classroom practice, but are not always recognized as such.</strong>
</div>

You can find a historical overview of the origins of computational thinking in the learning path ['History'](https://www.dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=ct7_historiek&language=nl&te=true&source_page=%2Fcomputational_thinking%2F&source_title=%20Computationeel%20Denken#ct_historiek1;nl;3).<br>
Through the other learning paths of this project, you will become familiar with the new terminology and will be able to recognize aspects of computational thinking in your own teaching materials.
An initial need, the need for a workable definition of computational thinking, is already addressed in the learning path ['Definition and key points'](https://www.dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=ct2_concreet&language=nl&te=true&source_page=%2Fcomputational_thinking%2F&source_title=%20Computationeel%20Denken#ct_inleiding1;nl;3).
