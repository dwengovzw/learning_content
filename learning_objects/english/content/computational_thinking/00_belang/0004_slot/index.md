# Summary

<div class="alert alert-box alert-info">
    Computational thinking is regarded as a competency that makes us resilient in a rapidly changing society. There is therefore a growing focus on it in compulsory education, including in Flanders. Although computational thinking dates back to a time when there were no computers, teachers are still insufficiently familiar with it. Many aspects of computational thinking have been part of day-to-day classroom practice for years, but they are not always recognized as such.
