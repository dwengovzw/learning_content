# International importance

![](@youtube/https://www.youtube.com/embed/bfizj6FUaDo "Computational thinking - Importance")

> In this text, ‘computer’ is used in the broad sense of the word: the entirety of hardware and software of computers, smartphones, tablets, and other information-processing systems. 

Students learn about physics, chemistry, and biology because of the scientific processes in the world in which they live. **However, a significant part of their lives takes place digitally**. Think of social media, gaming, and online lessons. 
That digital world is becoming increasingly important. The development of all those digital devices and applications is carried out by people who can think computationally. **It is necessary that our students understand and can apply the basic concepts of computational thinking**, to make them see what underlies the increasingly digitized society. After all, we want students to understand the impact digitization has on their own lives and that in the future, as citizens, they can make well-founded decisions.

**Computational thinking is an approach to gaining insight into that digital world and interacting with it**. It is a way of thinking that underpins all digital applications. Computational thinking is a methodology that students can learn to tackle new problems and that provides guidance as a complement to other competencies needed to solve problems. It enables people to be resilient and flexible in the face of new digital applications. It is therefore not surprising that there is **all over the world** growing attention to it in compulsory education (Wing, 2006; Bocconi et al., 2016; Yadav et al., 2017a). 
 
All over the world, there is a call to teach young people to think computationally, and computational thinking is regarded as **a foundation for digital competencies, one of the 21st-century competencies** (Voogt et al., 2013; Yadav et al., 2017a; Li et al., 2020). So too in Flanders. <br>
Digital competencies themselves are considered a way to acquire and assess the other 21st-century competencies. That is the main reason why countries are introducing computational thinking into education. The European Union also endorses the importance of 21st-century competencies and the role that computational thinking can play in them. 

In short, more and more countries are choosing to include computational thinking in the learning objectives of secondary education. 

> Competencies are a set of knowledge, skills, and attitudes.<br>
> You can find more explanation about the 21st-century competencies in the learning path ['Attainment targets and minimum goals'](https://www.dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=ct8_eindtermen&language=nl&te=true&source_page=%2Fcomputational_thinking%2F&source_title=%20Computationeel%20Denken#ct_eindtermen;nl;3). 

<div class="alert alert-box alert-secondary">
The fact that great importance is attached worldwide to computational thinking is reflected in the fact that computational thinking has by now been included in the international comparative tests of the OECD and the IEA, respectively in the mathematics component of the <strong>PISA test</strong> and in the <strong>ICILS test</strong>.
