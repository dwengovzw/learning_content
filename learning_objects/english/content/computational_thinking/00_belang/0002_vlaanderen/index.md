Since September 2019, ‘computational thinking and acting’ has been part of the compulsory curriculum for all students in secondary education. For students in middle school (first grade of secondary education), ‘computational thinking and acting’ even received the status of basic literacy, which means that every individual student must achieve the set objectives. 

Flemish secondary education was recently reformed with newly defined minimum learning goals divided over 16 key competencies. One of the key competencies is ‘Digital competence and media literacy’ with as a starting point “responding to digital developments and the importance of basic knowledge and proper use of ICT in order to be able to participate in society" (AHOVOKS, 2020). 

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
    <strong><h5>Attainment targets</h5></strong>
    These minimum learning goals are called attainment targets or minimum goals. <br>
    <br>
    On 16 June 2022, the Constitutional Court annulled the new attainment targets for the second and third grade of secondary education. These have since been reworked. The new minimum goals will take effect on 1 September 2023 in the third and fifth year of secondary education.

The key competency ‘Digital competence and media literacy’ is composed of three building blocks: 

* The building block ‘Digital media and applications to create, participate and interact’ about the use of information and communication technology. E.g. the use of online tools, creating digital content, and digital citizenship. This building block is related to learning goals on acquiring and managing information from the key competency on learning. 

* The building block **‘Computational thinking and acting’**, which aims at “basic knowledge and skills in the field of computer science”, and for example also aims to foster problem-solving thinking. 

* The building block ‘Responsible, critical and ethical use of digital and non-digital media and information’ around media literacy. This building block is about, among other things, the impact of technological development on society and the associated ethical aspects. This building block should also strengthen critical thinking. 

> The key competencies are:
> - competencies in the area of physical, mental and emotional awareness and in the area of physical, mental and emotional health; competencies in Dutch; 
> - competencies in other languages; digital competence and media literacy;
> - social-relational competencies;
> - competencies in mathematics, the exact sciences and technology;
> - citizenship competencies including competencies regarding living together; competencies related to historical awareness;
> - competencies related to spatial awareness;
> - competencies regarding sustainability; economic and financial competencies;
> - legal competencies;
> - learning competencies including research competencies, innovation thinking, creativity, problem-solving and critical thinking, systems thinking, information processing and collaboration;
> - self-awareness and self-expression, self-direction and agility;
> - development of initiative,  ambition, entrepreneurship and career competencies;
> - cultural awareness and cultural expression. 

Given the interweaving of the digital with all our lives, it is beyond doubt that the key competency ‘Digital competence and media literacy’ cannot be seen separately from the other fifteen key competencies. See also [onderwijsdoelen.be](https://onderwijsdoelen.be/uitgangspunten/4814).
