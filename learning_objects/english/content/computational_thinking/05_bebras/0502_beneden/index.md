# Example 2: Applying an algorithm

## Downward (Bebras 2012-FR-10)
Mrs. Beaver has placed a robot at the top of a maze. The robot descends through the maze from one platform to the one below it, until it reaches one of the cells at the very bottom. In doing so, it always moves in the same way: it first moves to the right, and each time it drops down to a lower platform, it starts again in the opposite direction.

The left image below shows the path the robot will follow in maze no. 1.

*If Mrs. Beaver places her robot at the far left in maze no. 2, into which cell will the robot ultimately fall?*
