## Shortest route (Bebras 2013-JP-10)

The little beaver likes to play in the park. His house (H) and the park (P) are connected by bridges made of logs of the same length, as you can see on the map below:

However, there are some places on the map, marked with a red X, that he cannot pass.

*How many different routes from the house to the park can he take with the same minimum length?*
