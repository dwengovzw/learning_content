## Random pictures (Bebras 2013-DE-02)

The beavers have a small company that designs personalized greeting cards and gift wrap. The different designs are created according to the following instructions:

1. Create a circle C of a random color.
2. Repeat the following steps a random number of times.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Create a square V of a random color and size.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Choose a random size for C: either *small*, or *large*.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Print C somewhere at a random position.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Print V somewhere at a random position.<br>

(For information: creating a shape means that the shape is created in the computer’s memory, but it is not printed or drawn on paper.)

Which of the following designs was not created by this company?
