# Abstraction

*When analyzing the assignment/problem statement, students leave out information that is not relevant to solving the problem.*
  
**Example**<br>
A kindergarten teacher must ensure that all children have their jackets on and fastened in time.

Only the following is relevant: whether the jacket opens/closes at the front, whether it can be fully opened/closed, and what fastening method the jacket has. Color, cut, with or without hood, type of fabric of the jacket ... is all irrelevant information.

AND/OR

*Students represent a description from the problem statement abstractly.*

**Example**<br>
The problem is to draw up a vegetable garden plan for four types of vegetables. 

When solving, it is best to represent the garden abstractly as a grid. The vegetable types will also need to be represented in some abstract way.

AND/OR

*Students must work with an abstract representation/description in the assignment.*

**Example 1**<br>
In reality, farmers sometimes want to develop a fertilization plan with the aim of optimizing efficiency for the next year. This means they use satellite images so as not to apply uniform fertilization across their entire field. A pixel in a satellite image then represents an area of about 5 meters by 5 meters, and farmers have to work with this abstract data.

**Example 2**<br>
Storm-resistant network (see Bebras learning path)
