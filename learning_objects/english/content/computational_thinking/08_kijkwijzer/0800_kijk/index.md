# Observation guide

You can use this observation guide to design an assignment yourself or to understand and/or assess to what extent computational thinking is or can be addressed in a worked-out assignment. 

* Start from the framework with the four core concepts.
 
* Use the clarifications/points of attention for the core concepts to review your assignment again, or to interpret, evaluate, and, if necessary, adjust the work of others or students.

* Tick if applicable.

<strong><h5>Note</h5></strong> 
<ul>
    <li>The four core concepts do not always all have to be addressed (this depends on the problem statement and its complexity).</li>
    <li>The core concepts are applied in service of solving a challenge/problem and are not practiced only in isolation.</li>
    <li>Nested approaches are also possible and sometimes even necessary (e.g., for subproblems/subtasks the core concepts can likewise be applied).</li>
    <li>When you give students an assignment, what they come up with is not necessarily identical to your solution, but their idea can still be meaningful.</li>
</ul>
