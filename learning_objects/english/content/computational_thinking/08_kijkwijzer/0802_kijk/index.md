# Decomposition

**Students identify manageable subproblems/elements and break the task down accordingly.**

The manageable subproblems are such that each is easier to solve than the entire problem. Combining their solutions will yield a solution to the entire problem.

<strong><h5>Note</h5></strong>
Splitting involves more than merely breaking the solution method into successive steps (so more/different than a complete action plan with the actions in sequence).

**Example 1**<br>
You are going to a concert in a completely unfamiliar city in another country. The stadium where the concert is being held is on the outskirts of the city, and you are staying in the city center. How do you get there?

This problem statement can be split into solving the following subproblems:

* What transportation options are there?
* What is the location of my accommodation relative to the pick-up/drop-off points of the transportation options?
* What is the location of the stadium relative to the pick-up/drop-off points of the transportation options?
* What are the schedules for the different transportation options?

**Example 2**<br>
In a STEM project, students are challenged to design a small robot to monitor water quality. The robot must take measurements in the water at distances where people cannot perform a ‘regular’ sampling (= simply scooping water).

This problem statement can be split into the following subproblems:

* How do I get the robot to go to the sampling locations and return?
* Which parameters do I take into account to measure water quality?
* How do I have the robot collect measurements?
