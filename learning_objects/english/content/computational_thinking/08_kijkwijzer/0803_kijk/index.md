# Pattern recognition

Students identify patterns (similarities, similar characteristics) in data/information and/or between subproblems (e.g., after decomposition).

**Example**<br>
A preschool teacher must ensure that all preschoolers have their jackets on and fastened in time.

Here, only the following is relevant: whether the jacket opens/closes at the front, whether it is completely open/closed, and which fastening technique the jacket uses (see abstraction).<br>
When solving this problem, pattern recognition will involve the similarities among the fastening techniques: toggles, zippers, buttons ...
