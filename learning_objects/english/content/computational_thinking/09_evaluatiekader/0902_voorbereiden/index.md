# Framework

## What do you want to achieve in students through computational thinking?

**Digital understanding**<br>
You want students to both know how to use a digital system and understand the underlying principles of digital systems.

**Decomposition**<br>
You want students to thoughtfully break a problem down into well-chosen subproblems, so that each part can be addressed separately and a solution to the problem can be obtained more easily.

**Abstraction**<br>
You want students to ignore information that is not needed to solve a problem, and to hide certain details in order to think about a problem at a high level. When tackling complex problems, abstraction is needed because reasoning proceeds more smoothly without the burden of irrelevant details.

**Pattern recognition**<br>
You want students to discover that certain aspects of a problem show similarities, allowing it to be simplified, and/or to recognize that a problem resembles a previously solved problem.

**Algorithmic thinking**<br>
You want students to make explicit a sequence of unambiguous instructions to be carried out step by step, and to realize that this sequence of instructions and their order are essential to produce the desired result.

**Testing and debugging**<br>
You want students to test a solution and evaluate whether their solutions work as intended, and to find, understand, and fix any errors.

**Generalizing**<br>
You want students to try to solve a new problem by applying an earlier solution or a variant of it. 

**Ethical and societal awareness**<br>
You want students to reflect on the ethical and societal implications of technology and digital solutions.

**Creativity**<br>
You want students to follow existing methods as well as seek new ways to solve problems. 

**Perseverance**<br>
You want students, when solving problems, to have the determination to keep going, try different approaches, and learn from their mistakes.

**Logical thinking**<br>
You want students to apply what they have learned in logic and mathematics when designing an algorithm.

**Modeling and simulating**<br>
You want students to design and use a mathematical model to simulate a given phenomenon. 

**Collecting, visualizing, and analyzing data**<br>
You want students to correctly assess which data are appropriate when tackling a problem, to collect those data, visualize them properly, and then analyze and interpret them. 

**Communicating**<br>
You want students to communicate clearly about their approach and solution to a problem, and justify the choices made. 

## How can you prepare to evaluate computational thinking? 

* Formulate the topic/learning activity.
* Note the educational objective/curriculum objective.
* Identify the concepts you want students to develop.
* Formulate learning objectives and, if desired, specify the level of mastery in Bloom's taxonomy.
* Formulate student assignments.
* Define the assessment methods.
* Fill in the evaluation sheet using the template provided below.
