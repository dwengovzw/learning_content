# Assessment framework

## Sentiment analysis using a rule-based system

**Learning objective:**<br>
Students analyze the impact of digital systems on society from the principles of computational thinking.

**Teacher preparation:**
- Fill in the CT concepts schema to clarify the link with the basic concepts of computational thinking.

**Learning goal to be assessed:** Students analyze the output of the AI system, in particular its limitations and possibilities, and see the connection with the societal impact of this system.

**Assignments for students:**
- Computational thinking about how automated, rule-based sentiment analysis works by means of an instructional conversation: "How do I bring this to the computer?".
- Students perform unplugged sentiment analysis on a review.
- Students critically argue what this means for societal impact by means of an instructional conversation.
- Students analyze the societal impact of a rule-based system for cyberbullying detection.
- Students look for (original) examples of language technology and share them with the class.
- Whole-class instructional conversation regarding patterns in how different language systems work.

**Assignments for students and proposed evaluation form:**
- Computational thinking about how automated, rule-based sentiment analysis works by means of an instructional conversation: "How do I bring this to the computer?" & whole-class exit ticket (qualitative evaluation, formative).
- Students perform unplugged sentiment analysis on a review & (individually or in groups) written report (correct or not - qualitative evaluation) (summative).
- Students critically argue what this means for societal impact by means of an instructional conversation & whole-class exit ticket (quantitative evaluation, formative).
- Students analyze the societal impact of a rule-based system for cyberbullying detection individually, written reflection report (interim evaluation qualitative, formative - quantitative, summative).
- Students look for (original) examples of language technology and share them with the class participation (done/not done - quantitative evaluation) (formative) and peer feedback (qualitative evaluation) (formative).
- Whole-class instructional conversation regarding patterns in how different language systems work & whole-class exit ticket (qualitative evaluation, formative).
