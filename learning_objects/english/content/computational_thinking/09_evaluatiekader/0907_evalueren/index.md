# Evaluating
## Evaluating the following learning activity: Exploring the social robot construction kit

![Kit](https://github.com/dwengovzw/learning_content/assets/48352335/3d5353ce-ff58-4eb5-a3b3-f859f917731a)

**Educational objective/curriculum objective:**<br>
Students distinguish building blocks of digital systems and explain how these work together to make the system function.

**Concepts:**
* Decomposition: identifying components + separating electronics/non-electronics
* Pattern recognition: recognizing input, processing, output and transport
* Abstraction: ignoring non-electronic components
* Digital insight: explaining how a digital system works

**Learning objectives:**
* Students identify each component of the construction kit and distinguish between electronics and non-electronics. (Understand)
* Students focus on the electronic components and ignore the non-electronic components. (Apply)
* Students recognize which electronic components are responsible for input, processing, output and transport. (Understand)
* Students connect self-selected electronic components to each other. (Apply)
* Students explain how the digital system can function. (Understand)

**Student tasks:**
* Students categorize the components of the construction kit as electronics and non-electronics.
* Students use the student cards to name each electronic component of the construction kit.
* Students classify the electronic components according to input, processing, output and transport.
* Students use the student cards to connect electronic components to the Dwenguino.
* Students explain how their digital system can function. They choose themselves how to explain this via a drawing, text, video ...

**Evaluation approach:**<br>
