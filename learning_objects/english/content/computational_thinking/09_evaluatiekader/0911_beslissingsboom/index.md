# Evaluation framework

## AI in Healthcare - decision trees (H4 and beyond)

**Learning objectives**
- Students use graphs for an application.
- Students analyze the interaction between science, technology, mathematics, and society based on societal challenges.    
- Students analyze the impact of digital systems on society from the principles of computational thinking.

**Teacher preparation:** 
- 

**Learning objective to be assessed:** 
- Students describe opportunities for the use of decision trees in healthcare. 
- Students describe that a number is needed to allow a computer to estimate the dispersion of variables.
- Students generate a decision tree from a table using Python.

**Assignments for students:**
- Whole-class instructional discussion about decision trees using 'real' examples.
- Whole-class instructional discussion: Computational thinking: what is needed to enable a computer to construct a decision tree.
- Prepare for the next lesson: exercises on the Gini index.
- Test on the Gini index.
- Construct a decision tree (unplugged) from a given table.
- Construct the same decision tree (plugged) with a Python notebook.
- Brief individual presentation on the limitations and opportunities of using decision trees in the healthcare sector.
 
**Assessment scheme:**

**Assignments for students and proposed assessment format:**
- Whole-class instructional discussion about decision trees using 'real' examples & Class-wide (1-2-3) exit ticket (qualitative & formative).
- Whole-class instructional discussion: Computational thinking: what is needed to enable a computer to construct a decision tree & Class-wide (1-2-3) exit ticket (qualitative & formative).
- Prepare for the next lesson: exercises on the Gini index & Participation: done/not done (quantitative & formative).
- Test on the Gini index & Traditional test (quantitative & summative).
- Construct a decision tree (unplugged) from a given table & Participation: done/not done (quantitative & formative).
- Construct the same decision tree (plugged) with a Python notebook & Project: successful/not successful (quantitative & formative) or check for correct modification of code, naming of variables (quantitative & summative).
- Brief individual presentation on the limitations and opportunities of using decision trees in the healthcare sector & Project: document (qualitative & summative).
