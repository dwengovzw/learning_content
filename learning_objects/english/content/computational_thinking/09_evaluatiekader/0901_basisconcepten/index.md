# Evaluating basic concepts

## Computational thinking in approaching a problem

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
<strong><h5>A definition of computational thinking</h5></strong> 
<em>Computational thinking is a methodology to tackle a complex problem, in such a way that a computer could be used to solve it.</em>
</div>

Computational thinking relies on four **basic concepts**: decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking. <br>
You received more explanation about these concepts [here](https://www.dwengo.org/backend/api/learningObject/getWrapped?hruid=ct_voorbeelden1&version=3&language=nl).


## Possible learning objectives of computational thinking

As a teacher, you will consider which knowledge, skills, and attitudes of computational thinking are addressed in a particular series of lessons, after which you will choose which ones you will assess and how. <br>
**When solving a problem, a basic concept will not appear in isolation.** Thus, multiple goals that correspond to multiple basic concepts can be assessed.
