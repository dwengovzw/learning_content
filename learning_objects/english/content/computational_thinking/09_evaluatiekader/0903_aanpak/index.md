# Evaluation approach

## Template

We propose a template that can be used as 'evaluation preparation'.
As a teacher, you can use this template to reflect on the evaluation for a specific assignment or project.

The template comprises four elements:<br>
- the complexity of the assignment;
- the frequency and type of evaluation;
- the nature of the evaluation;
- who evaluates.

For each of these elements there are four options, numbered from 1 through 4 (this does not imply a gradation).


||Complexity|Evaluation moments|Nature of the evaluation|Who evaluates?|
