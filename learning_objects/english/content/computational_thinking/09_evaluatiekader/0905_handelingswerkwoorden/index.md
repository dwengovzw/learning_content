# Action verbs

> Click [Here](https://docs.vlaamsparlement.be/pfile?id=1970520) for the draft decree, as presented in the Flemish Parliament.

* Attainment targets are minimum goals in the form of concisely formulated objective sentences with
clear action verbs in which the knowledge is explicitly stated each time and,
where appropriate, the relevant context. The entirety of each attainment target is written in such a way that
it is clear what is expected (assessability). The attainment targets are, in their coherence,
competence-oriented: the total set of attainment targets determines students’ ability to
apply knowledge, insights, skills, and attitudes in their actions. Not in every
attainment target are all of these elements necessarily addressed separately.

* An attainment target basically consists of 1 objective sentence with 1 action verb, but where
necessary, multiple action verbs may be chosen.

* The knowledge is, in principle, integrated into the objective sentence and, where appropriate,
made explicit separately.

* Relevant, functional contexts are only included in the objective sentence if
necessary.

* Attainment targets have no didactic framing.

* Knowledge that was covered in the attainment targets of primary education or a preceding
grade is, as a rule, no longer repeated in the attainment targets of the subsequent
grade.

> This is a list of all [Action verbs](embed/handelingswerkwoorden.pdf).

When in the specific attainment targets for ‘Physics’ the action verbs ‘quantify’ and
‘analyze’ are used, the following is meant:
* analyze: look for relationships between given data and draw an (own) conclusion;
* quantify: reason by making use of relationships, formulas,
equations


In the curriculum *'II-CoTa-d'* of KOV, for 'Communication Sciences and Language Technology', second grade transition finality, you read: <br>
*"In the glossary you will find synonyms for and explanations of a number of action verbs that you will find in curriculum objectives and (specific) minimum goals of different grades."*<br>
