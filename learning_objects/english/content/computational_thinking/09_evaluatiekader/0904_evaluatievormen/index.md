# Assessment methods

## Common assessment methods

**Written assignment - closed questions**<br>
In an assignment with closed questions, the teacher evaluates a written performance in which the student selects an answer from a pre-established set of possible answers. Examples of closed questions are multiple-choice questions, 'true/false' questions, matching questions, ordering questions ...

Multiple-choice questions can be used to quickly assess students' basic knowledge, or even to check whether students are attentive to certain pitfalls and can handle certain challenges.<br>There are already quite a few multiple-choice questions available to, for example, test students' aptitude in computational thinking or how they can apply computational thinking concepts in context. They can also often be used some time after the material has been taught to determine the extent to which students ultimately master it.

> Note: Not all aspects of computational thinking can be assessed with multiple-choice questions (Roman-Gonzalez et al., 2019; Weintrop et al., 2021).

Short closed questions are used, for example, to assess programming skills: students must, for example, predict the outcome of a program, fill in missing pieces, or put the instructions in the correct order.   

**Written assignment - open questions**<br>
In an assignment with open questions, the teacher evaluates a written performance by the student in which the student independently formulates an answer to open questions. For open questions aimed at testing factual knowledge, answers are concise, ranging from a single word to at most a few lines; how long an expected answer is also depends on the grade level and the field of study.<br>
For open questions that test understanding or application, answers are usually more extensive, starting at least with a paragraph. These questions contain verbs such as 'describe', 'calculate', 'prove', 'assess', 'advise', 'draw' ...

Open questions and open-ended assignments are suitable for assessing whether students can explain something or to determine whether they can create something, as opposed to multiple-choice questions (Weintrop et al., 2021).<br>
Pen-and-paper can also be meaningful in the context of creating an artifact, e.g., to have them write down which representations they will use, to design an algorithm in pseudocode, or to draw a design of a solution (Weintrop et al., 2021).

> Note: If students learned to program in a block-based programming environment that always shows which blocks are available, and the evaluation is done with pen and paper, you may be testing the ability to remember the blocks rather than the ability to program with them (Weintrop et al., 2021). 

**Interview**<br>
During an interview, the teacher asks targeted questions to the student to gain deeper insight into the student's knowledge, skills, way of thinking, and possibly also feelings or motivations. It helps the teacher to better understand the student.

Assessing students by means of a conversation can, however, take a lot of time, but in this way you can thoroughly examine students' competencies.

**Self-assessment**<br>
In self-assessment, the student is directly involved. The teacher challenges the student to reflect on their own performance (self-evaluation) and to determine what went well and what can be improved (self-reflection). The student evaluates themselves based on pre-established criteria. This can take the form of a rubric, checklist, or guiding questions.

Completing self-assessment questionnaires can sometimes suffer from self-report bias: there is a difference between how highly one rates a certain competence in oneself and how competent one actually is (Weintrop et al., 2021). The advantage is that it is a faster method than, for example, an interview. 

**Peer feedback**<br>
Peer feedback involves fellow students, and students give constructive feedback on each other's learning process and/or end product. It is important that the feedback is specific and focused on improvement, making it a mutual learning process in which students learn from each other and improve their own skills.

> Pair programming: When students program in pairs, with one student typing the code and the other critically reviewing it, peer feedback happens spontaneously.<br>
It is important that these two students regularly switch roles.

**Project**<br>
When assessing a project, the teacher evaluates a product that has been created as the outcome of an assignment. This often also maps out the degree of independence and/or creativity the student(s) show in processing the subject matter.   

A project is suitable to determine whether students also (spontaneously) apply the concepts of computational thinking. For example, it may involve writing a program that is executed in a simulator. Or it may include designing, building, and programming a robot. Another example is developing a computational model for a real-world phenomenon. Evaluating an artifact is challenging for the teacher. The assessment can, for example, be carried out using a rubric, in which what will be evaluated is mapped out very clearly in advance, without penalizing the student's creativity (Roman-Gonzalez et al., 2019; Weintrop et al., 2021).

> A project alone is not sufficient to also determine whether students fully understand the concepts themselves (Roman-Gonzalez et al., 2019; Weintrop et a;., 2021).  

**Oral assignment**<br>
The assessment of an oral assignment usually takes place in a one-on-one setting between teacher and student. The oral performance can range from answering knowledge questions to discussing the submitted project.

**Presentation**<br>
In a presentation, the teacher assesses a student's oral performance in front of an audience. The audience may be fellow students, other teachers, external people ... Presenting is a skill that is not only about knowledge transfer, but also about how information is communicated effectively and convincingly to an audience.  

**Observation**<br>
In observation, the teacher looks purposefully at the students. In an observation, cognitive aspects can be assessed, such as the concrete execution of a particular task, skill, or concept. But non-cognitive aspects of learning can also be assessed, such as social behavior, collaboration, attitude toward learning ...

**Participation**<br>
When assessing participation, the teacher evaluates the student based on active involvement and participation in classroom activities. The teacher can assess both the actual (quantity) and the substantive (quality) participation.

**Open-book assessment**<br>
In an open-book assessment, students have access to supporting teaching and learning materials during (part or all of) the assessment. 

**Ticket/starter task**<br>
Tickets and starter tasks assess what students have remembered and understood during the lesson. These assessments can take different forms, including an *exit ticket*, a 3-2-1 ticket, and a starter task, and can take place either individually or as a whole-class activity.<br>
* An exit ticket asks students to answer short questions or complete a task at the end of a lesson.
* The 3-2-1 ticket asks students to share, respectively, 3 things they learned, 2 things they found interesting, and 1 question they still have.
* The starter task is an activity at the beginning of the lesson to activate prior knowledge.

**Portfolio**<br>
When assessing a portfolio, the teacher evaluates a collection of materials created by the student that makes the student's efforts, progress, and achievements visible. The content of the portfolio is determined by the purpose of the portfolio: showcasing the student's best work, what the student has learned, or how the student is learning.

To assess the content of a portfolio, you can use rubrics, for example. If you create the rubric in parallel with determining the different assignments, it may become apparent that certain assignments are insufficient to assess particular concepts and practices of computational thinking, or that certain assignments require competencies other than those you want to assess. Also be sure to check whether the assignments can be misinterpreted, and clarify them for the students with an eye to the assessment (Weintrop et al., 2021). 

## Technology support

* An assessment of programming skills using the computer has the advantage that students can test and debug their program. If they have access to a simulator, they get even more real-time feedback. Assignments that leverage these technological advantages have the potential to assess more complex competencies.

* You may have the possibility as a teacher to log students' activities on the computer. You can analyze the data to see whether students have acquired certain competencies, and use this information to evaluate them.

* Do be careful that students are not penalized for exploring and experimenting; working on the computer encourages trying all sorts of things, which may distract them from the actual goal of the assignment.

* In that case, multiple strategies and ways to complete the assignment should also be allowed.
  
Assessing computational thinking in this way can provide a better picture of how students would act in the real world, but it is challenging for the teacher (Weintrop et al., 2021).

To assess computational thinking integrated into a STEM context, students will, for example, work with a simulation tool (Weintrop et al., 2021).<br> 
Make sure that students then:
* work purposefully by providing questions they must answer; 
* not only 'play' with the tool, but make sure to ask for the interpretation of what they see.
