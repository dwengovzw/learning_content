# Evaluation framework

## Social robot: get started with the Dwengo simulator. Simple programming tasks aimed at learning and practicing principles and elements of programming.  

**Learning objective:**<br>
Students design an algorithm to solve a problem digitally.

**Prior knowledge:**
- Students reformulate a problem in such a way that it becomes possible to solve the problem using a computer.<br>
- Students design an algorithm by explicitly stating a series of ordered instructions to solve the problem.

**Learning objective to be assessed:** 
- Students convert the algorithm into graphical code.
- Students execute the code (resulting in a simulation).
- Students debug the code.

**Assignments for the students:**
- Programming exercises.
- Debugging.
- Complete self-reflection form.

**Assessment scheme:**

**Assignments for the students and suggested assessment form:**
- Programming exercises & Project: assessment of code (quantitative & formative).
- Debugging & Rubric.
- Complete self-reflection form & Self-reflection: after a somewhat larger exercise (qualitative & formative).
