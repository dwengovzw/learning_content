# Evaluating students' computational thinking

Computational thinking can be addressed in all regular lessons. Whenever students are confronted with a problem, computational thinking can offer guidance in the search for a solution. Depending on the nature of the problem, certain concepts and practices of computational thinking may or may not be involved.

The assessment will therefore need to be aligned with those concepts and practices, and due to the wide variation there will also be a wide variety of assessment formats. Depending on the duration and importance of an assignment, there may, for example, be more or fewer assessment moments, and the type and character of the assessment can differ at each assessment moment. The way in which computational thinking is evaluated must be tailored to the specific context within which the assessment is conducted (Weintrop et al., 2021). 

An assessment moment can have multiple goals (Weintrop et al., 2021):<br>
* promoting learning;
* assessing a performance;
* determining whether the learning objectives of a curriculum have been achieved.

This learning path proposes an assessment framework.

* In the section *'Evaluating basic concepts'*, the definition of computational thinking and its basic concepts are revisited, and using learning objectives the link is made between the concepts and their application. Teachers are shown how they can present and assess the principles of computational thinking to their students, and how they can provide more targeted feedback.
* In the section *'Preparing assessment'*, the computational skills that students can acquire through learning activities are listed. These serve as a basis for determining the learning objectives of the learning activity, after which the assignments for students and the assessment formats are chosen. This information can be entered in the template of the assessment sheet.
* In the section *'Assessment approach'*, the focus is on clarifying the characteristics of the assessment, namely 'complexity of the assignment', 'assessment moments', 'who assesses?' and 'character of the assessment'. When entering the characteristics into the template of the assessment sheet, these are displayed visually in a spider web diagram.
* In the section *'Assessment formats'*, you can find an overview of common assessment formats and the popular assessment methods in computer science education are explained in more detail.
