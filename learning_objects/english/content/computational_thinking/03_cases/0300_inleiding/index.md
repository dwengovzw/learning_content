# Schema of computational thinking concepts
In this learning pathway you will find worked-out examples of how you can bring computational thinking into existing lessons. These can inspire you. <br>

We do this using a schema. This schema provides you, as a teacher, with a guideline when preparing your lessons around concepts of computational thinking.

![Basic concepts schema](embed/schema.png "Basic concepts schema CT")

When filling in the schema you start from the basic concepts, but other concepts and practices of computational thinking automatically emerge as well.<br>
Not all boxes need to be filled in. The bottom box 'programming' is optional. Programming does not always need to be included. Even the computer does not always need to be included. Note, however, never working with the computer in any assignment is not an option either.  

From the title of an example you can tell from the parentheses which secondary grade is the focus.
- nothing inside the parentheses? for everyone
- 1, 2 and/or 3? for the 1st, 2nd and/or 3rd grade respectively
- s? more specific target group (as described in the learning object)
