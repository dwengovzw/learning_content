# Design and build a social robot

**Multiple sub-assignments as part of designing, building, and programming a social robot.**

In the 'Social robot' project, students make a sketch of their dream robot.<br>They think about how their robot will communicate with people, and they describe this with an algorithm. They write down which sensors and actuators are needed for this.

Afterwards, they adapt the design based on (self-)imposed criteria and the limitations of the sensors and actuators in the construction kit they have. <br>

Finally, they create a physical robot based on their own design.

**Target group**: 1st or 2nd grade - all finalities; 3rd grade - labor-market finality; all grades - OKAN

**Subject**: 1st grade Technology - STEM - Computer Science; 2nd grade STEM - Computer Science; 3rd grade PAV - STEM

**Prerequisites:** None

### Challenge: Design your dream robot and make a sketch of it. Show how this social robot communicates with people.

### Step 2: The students adjust the design based on (self-)imposed criteria and the limitations of the sensors and actuators in the construction kit they have. (The criteria may be self-imposed and/or imposed by the teacher.)

### Step 3: The students realize the robot based on the design first in the simulator and then as a physical robot.

### Step 4: The students detect certain patterns and apply abstraction.

### Specifically: The students implement desired actions in the simulator.

### Specifically: The students mount the hardware on the body of the robot.
