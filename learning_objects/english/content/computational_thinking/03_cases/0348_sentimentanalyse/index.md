# Sentiment analysis

**Designing an AI system for sentiment analysis.**



**Target audience:** Students in the 2nd and 3rd stage of a language track.

**Subject:** ...

**Prior knowledge:** Students know that sentiment analysis can be done using a lexicon.

A possible **sequence** for the case study is as follows:<br><br>

*Phase 1*<br>
<ul>
    <li>You give an introduction to sentiment analysis.
    <li>You explain the sentiment value of a word (a number between -2 and 2).
    <li>The students study the lexicon and find out what is listed in it.</li>
</ul>

*Phase 2*<br>
<ul>
    <li>The students are given the sentence for which they must determine the sentiment.
    <li>The students brainstorm about how to approach the problem (decomposition and algorithmic thinking).
    <li>The students fill in the diagram with the basic concepts.
</ul>

*Phase 3*<br>
<ul>
    <li>The students look up the sentiment value of the individual words.
    <li>The students determine the sentiment of the sentence.</li>
</ul>

*Phase 4*<br>
<ul>
    <li>The students reflect on the limitations of the system.
    <li>Whole-class debrief. Discuss the impact of such systems on society; they are used to extract information—whether correct or not—from data, such as social media posts.</li>
</ul>
