# Conversations in the Harry Potter books

If, in Dutch class (or another language course), you want to extract information from a book, you can visualize data from the text in a structured way by using graphs. With graphs you can, for example, reveal relationships between a book's characters. In this case study, we visualized the conversations from the book *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, first only for chapter 11 (figure 1), then for the entire book (figure 2).
