# Coloring Jommeke
**An AI system to color Jommeke comic strips**

On the Dwengo website you can find an AI system to automatically color Jommeke comic strips. It is a generative AI system that can be used to add color to the first Jommeke comics, which were still black and white. However, this coloring does not always turn out well.

This case study gives you more insight into what AI can mean in other fields (such as in art), but also into its shortcomings. Be sure to also check the [lesson theme 'Art'](https://www.dwengo.org/art/) from which this case study originates.


**Target group:** everyone
