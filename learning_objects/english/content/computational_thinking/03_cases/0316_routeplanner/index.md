# Distance as the crow flies

**Determining the distance as the crow flies.**

*Students can approach this problem in several ways, e.g., by using an atlas or an online route planner. However, students find that they can obtain the result more quickly if they enlist the help of a computer.*

**Target group:** first grade

**Subject:** 
* Geography
* ICT

**Prior knowledge:** 
* Students can use an atlas. 
* Students know the meaning of the scale indicated on a map.
* Students know that online route planners exist. 

### First possible approach

### Second possible approach

Students may use another route planner that does not have the option to request the distance as the crow flies. <br><br>
These students can obtain the distance as the crow flies
* calculate it using the Pythagorean theorem (required prior knowledge: students know the Pythagorean theorem); 
* find it by measuring (make a drawing themselves and measure, or measure on the figure from the route planner);
*  **additional prior knowledge**: students know the concept of similar triangles and can relate it to the scale of a map.
