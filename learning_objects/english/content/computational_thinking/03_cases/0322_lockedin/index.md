# Locked-in Syndrome

**Discuss in class how someone who is only able to blink with one eye can still write a book.** 

Using this real-life *case*, you will work unplugged with concepts and practices of computational thinking and help students see that people are central in the development of new technological applications. 

This case is part of the project ['AI in healthcare'](https://www.dwengo.org/care/), but can also be carried out independently of that project.

**Target audience:** first stage A and B track or second stage labor-market-oriented track

**Subject:** ...

**Prerequisites:** none

A possible **course** of the case study is as follows:<br><br>

*Phase 1: introduction*<br>
<ul>
    <li>Students read Bauby's story or you tell them about it.
    <li>Students come up with ideas to still be able to communicate in Bauby's situation.</li>
</ul>

*Phase 2: discussion of the system*<br>
<ul>
    <li>Discuss the following system: blink once for 'a', twice for 'b' ...
    <li>You can also introduce terminology such as algorithm, protocol, effective and efficient.</li>
</ul>

*Phase 3: Bauby's system*<br>
<ul>
    <li>Students try out Bauby's system. In the algorithm Bauby used, the helper read the alphabet aloud. When the letter Bauby was thinking of was spoken, he blinked his eye. The helper wrote that letter down and then started again, letter by letter.
    <li>Students come up with ways to improve that system.
    <li>Discuss that when developing a system you must take into account the person who will have to use that system. For example, it is best to consider that person's preferences and feelings.</li>
</ul>

*Phase 4: techniques to improve the system*<br>
<ul>
    <li>You look at some techniques, for example guessing a word when half of it is already there or using frequency analysis.
    <li>You discuss factors that can reduce the time needed to dictate the book, such as using a divide-and-conquer algorithm.</li>
</ul>

*Phase 5: debrief*<br>
<ul> 
    <li>Students design a digital system that could replace Bauby's helper.
    <li>Students discuss the impact of that system on the help-seeker.</li>
</ul>
