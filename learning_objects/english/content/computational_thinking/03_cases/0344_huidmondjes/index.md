# Automating stomata counting

**Classroom discussion of how a neural network for object recognition works to automatically count stomata in microscopic photos.**

The KIKS neural network was developed to help a researcher at Meise Botanic Garden count stomata on microscopic photos of plant leaves. This is in the context of research into which plants adapt well to climate change. 

In class, you can discuss with the students how such a convolutional network is trained and how it works.

**Target group:** Students in the 2nd or 3rd grade with a scientific background.

**Subject:** 
* Biology
* Geography
* STEM
* Computer science

**Prior knowledge:** 
* Students know the background of the KIKS project. 
* Students know what stomata are and what their function is. 
* Preferably, students have already completed the 'Microscopy' lab of the KIKS project (or a similar lab). 

<div class="alert alert-box alert-warning">
<strong>Automatically counting stomata - activity and class discussion</strong><br>
<ul>
    <li>Students can submit their own microscopic photos of plant leaves to the KIKS neural network to have it count the stomata on them.</li>
    <li>They can brainstorm about the neural network.</li>
    <li>What should such an artificial intelligence system be able to do?</li>
    <li>Which aspects are involved?</li>
    <li>The KIKS neural network will not perform equally well on all of the students' photos. Often it will even perform below par. This is an excellent moment to talk with the students about bias, one of the ethical aspects associated with neural networks.</li>
</ul>
</div>

The reflections and conclusions from the class discussion can be summarized in a diagram.
