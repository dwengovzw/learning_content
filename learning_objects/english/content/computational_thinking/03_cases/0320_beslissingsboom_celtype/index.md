title: Decision tree for determining cell type (1)
version: 3

# Decision tree for determining cell type

In this case, your students will work on creating a decision tree that determines, for a given cell, whether it is a bacterium, fungus, plant, or animal. When designing the tree, students must break down a complex task into different subtasks.

**Target group:** first grade, A-stream

**Subject:** ...

**Prior knowledge:** students have basic knowledge about cells

A possible progression of the case study is as follows:
<ol>
    <li>You explain to the students what decision trees are and how they can draw them.
    <li>The students are tasked with creating a decision tree to determine, starting from a cell, whether it is a bacterium, fungus, plant, or animal.
    <li>The students assess a classmate's decision tree using predefined criteria (content, classification, visualization).
    <li>They use the feedback to create a second version of their decision tree.
</ol>
