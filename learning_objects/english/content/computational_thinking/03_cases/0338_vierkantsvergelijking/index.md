# The quadratic equation

**Automating the solving of a quadratic equation.**

Do you want to program with your students in math class? This topic lends itself to that.

Together with the students, you build an application step by step to automate solving a quadratic equation. Step by step, you further develop the application.

This application can then be used when solving problems. The focus then shifts more to the problem and less to the calculation.

> Reducing a problem to the quadratic equation that needs to be solved is a form of abstraction.

<div class="alert alert-box alert-warning">
In the case on the Pythagorean theorem you can see how to gradually develop such an application, starting from computational thinking.
</div>

With programming, you can go as far as you want. In this worked example, we cover variables, data types, operators, logical expressions and the selection structure, ask the user for input, and use built-in and user-defined functions. We also use Python modules (libraries) and pay attention to writing comments. <br>
> If desired, you can further improve the application and also start working with loop structures. For example, you can use a conditional loop to have it check whether the entered coefficient of the quadratic equation is not zero.

**Target group:** 2nd stage - transfer finality, 3rd stage - double finality

**Subject:** Mathematics

**Prior knowledge:**
* Students can solve a quadratic equation manually. They know the formulas for the discriminant and the roots.
* Students know a selection structure (or it can be introduced here in class).

Depending on whether students have already been introduced to using functions in a program, the pattern recognition and abstraction can be addressed from the start or later. You can work step by step. You can first write a program without applying the aforementioned pattern recognition and abstraction. That program can then be the starting point for working with a user-defined function and explaining its advantages.
