<context>
**Problem Statement**<br>
The fundamental relationship between current, voltage, and resistance is described by Ohm's Law <em>U = I . R</em>.
</context>
<decomposition>
**Decomposition**<br>
<ul>
    <li>The concepts of electric current, voltage, and resistance are explained individually before discussing their relationship according to Ohm's Law.</li>
    <li>The relationship between current, voltage, and resistance is explored, e.g., by measuring voltage and current and plotting these values in a graph.</li>
    <li>When solving practice problems using Ohm's Law, the problem is broken down into specific steps to calculate each quantity. For example, identifying the relevant data in the problem statement first.</li>
</ul>
</decomposition>
<patternRecognition>
**Pattern Recognition**<br>
<ul>
    <li>By measuring voltage and current and plotting the data in a graph, students observe how these electrical quantities relate to each other and identify relevant <strong>patterns and trends</strong> in the data.</li>
    <li>Ohm's Law shows the relationship between current, voltage, and resistance. Recognizing <strong>patterns of change</strong> in these quantities when values are adjusted helps to understand the fundamental relationship.</li>
    <li>Ohm's Law applies to various situations. Students recognize its applicability across different electrical circuits and problems. When solving exercises, they must identify whether it involves Ohm's Law. Later, they will connect it to other concepts such as conductivity, power, and resistor configurations.</li>
</ul>
</patternRecognition>
<abstraction>
**Abstraction**<br>
<ul>
    <li>The concepts of electric charge, current, voltage, and resistance are <strong>abstract representations of physical phenomena</strong> that are not directly visible but crucial for understanding electricity.</li>
    <li>Schematic representation of an electrical circuit: components, wires, and connections are depicted with standardized symbols and lines. These symbols are <strong>abstract</strong> representations focusing on function rather than physical appearance.</li>
    <li>Solving a problem involves abstract thinking: analyzing the problem, identifying core concepts, and abstracting essential details to reach the solution.</li>
    <li>The mathematical formula of Ohm's Law '<em>U = I . R</em>' is an abstract representation of the fundamental relationship between current, voltage, and resistance.</li>
</ul>
</abstraction>
<algorithms>
**Algorithmic Thinking**<br>
<ul>
    <li>Applying Ohm's Law (<em>U = I . R</em>) to calculate current, voltage, or resistance requires a step-by-step approach: identify data, apply the formula correctly, perform calculations, and interpret results.</li>
    <li>In a lab experiment, students use algorithmic thinking to systematically identify components and connections, perform measurements, and analyze results.</li>
</ul>
</algorithms>
<implementation>
**Program**<br>
Not applicable; this is a conceptual activity.
