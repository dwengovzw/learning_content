<context>
**Problem Statement**<br>
What are electric charge, current, voltage, and resistance? <br>
Which safety principles should be followed when handling electrical setups and devices?
</context>
<decomposition>
**Decomposition**<br>
Not provided.
</decomposition>
<patternRecognition>
**Pattern Recognition**<br>
<ul>
    <li>Students apply safety principles across different electrical devices and situations, recognizing that <b>universal precautions</b> are applied in various contexts.</li>
</ul>
</patternRecognition>
<abstraction>
**Abstraction**<br>
<ul>
    <li>Concepts such as electric charge, current, voltage, and resistance are <b>abstract representations of real physical phenomena</b> that are not directly visible but are crucial for understanding electricity.</li>
    <li>Schematic representation of an electrical setup: components, wires, and connections are depicted using standardized symbols and lines. These symbols are <b>abstract representations</b> that omit the actual physical form and focus on function and role in the circuit.</li>
</ul>
</abstraction>
<algorithms>
**Algorithmic Thinking**<br>
<ul>
    <li>When learning about electrical safety, students may follow step-by-step plans or checklists, such as turning off power sources or wearing protective equipment.</li>
    <li>During lab experiments, students use algorithmic thinking to systematically identify components and connections, perform measurements, and complete procedures.</li>
</ul>
</algorithms>
<implementation>
Not applicable.
