# Assessing COVID-19 Measures

**Classroom discussion of the impact of measures during an epidemic.**

When an infectious disease breaks out, it is important to gain insight into how it may spread over the following days and weeks. This will help plan the optimal use of resources and personnel to halt the spread of the disease. Moreover, before we implement these measures, we need to know how they can influence the course of the disease, so that the most efficient and least expensive measures can be implemented first.

To answer these and other key questions, disease spread models are often used. These models are based on mathematical equations that describe how an infectious disease spreads over time and/or space. They can be used to answer relevant questions such as:

* Without intervention, will the disease die out or spread uncontrollably?
* How many people need to be vaccinated to stop the spread?
* How does the behavior of people or animals affect the spread of diseases?
* What effect will different quarantine measures have?
* Since progression over time is crucial in the case of disease spread, almost all disease spread models are dynamic in nature. They therefore model a change over time. 

**Target group:** 3rd stage (upper secondary) - tracks with at least 6 hours of mathematics
