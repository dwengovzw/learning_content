# Pregnancy test

**Study how a digital pregnancy test works and compare it with a non-digital test.**

On the market, pregnancy tests are available in both non-digital and digital forms. The digital ones are considerably more expensive. The students compare how both systems work. Then, the class can discuss the pros and cons of both systems and whether the additional cost is worth it. 

**Target group:** third stage, labor-market finality

**Subject:** PAV

**Prior knowledge:**
- Students know concepts such as input and output.
- They have already been introduced to selection structures (IF-THEN constructs).

**Class discussion:** This example also includes a form of reflection. Is digitizing a pregnancy test actually useful? What are the pros and cons?
