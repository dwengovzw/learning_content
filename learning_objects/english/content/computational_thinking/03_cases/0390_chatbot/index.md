# Rule-based chatbot

**_Case in design phase_**<br>

How can a chatbot link an asked question that is not in its 'dictionary' to a question that is, and that most closely resembles the asked question?

**Target audience:** everyone

**Subject:** Language technology, mathematics (in context), PAV

The chatbot uses the **distance** between words or sentences.

**Prerequisites:** The students can read, count, and work with fractions.
