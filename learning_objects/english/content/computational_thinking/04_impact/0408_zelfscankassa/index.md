## Discussion of the impact

-  The impact of self-checkouts concerns various aspects of society. For example, the hardware enables fast scans, the software automates payments and inventory management, and the user interface makes it easy for customers to pay on their own.
-  The goal is to speed up payment processes and reduce waiting times in stores and supermarkets. 
- Self-checkouts are changing the way people shop and pay. At the same time, they bring concerns, such as privacy concerns and employment issues. Some stores install cameras that record what happens at the self-checkouts.


Purchase history and profiling: When customers scan products and pay with self-checkouts, data about their purchases is collected. This information can be used to build detailed purchase profiles of customers. Companies can use this data to show targeted advertisements, but this may be considered an invasion of privacy.

Payment transactions: When using self-checkouts, payment data, such as credit card information or mobile payments, is processed. It is crucial that this data is adequately secured to prevent it from being exposed to hackers or unauthorized access.

Cameras and surveillance: Some self-checkouts use cameras to scan products. This can lead to concerns about surveillance and the potential infringement of customers’ privacy, especially if the footage is captured or stored in any way.

Customer identification: Some self-checkouts require customers to verify their identity, for example by means of a membership card or mobile app. This can lead to concerns about tracking customers’ presence in the store and monitoring their behavior.

Data sharing: In some cases, data collected by self-checkouts can be shared with third parties, such as manufacturers or advertisers. This can lead to concerns about the privacy of customer data.

To address these privacy concerns, companies that offer self-checkouts must adhere to strict security standards and be transparent about the collection and use of customer data. Customers should also be informed about how their data is used and should have the option to give or withhold consent. It is of great importance that customers’ personal and financial data is handled securely to safeguard their privacy.
