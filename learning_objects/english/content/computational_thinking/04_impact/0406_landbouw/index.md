# Precision agriculture

Agriculture provides us with food. Furthermore, agriculture is important for the economy, including employment, exports, and the supply of raw materials.
The way farming is practiced affects not only current society but also future generations.
Automating certain tasks can reduce farmers' workload. Through precision agriculture - precision agriculture relies on digital applications - the production of crops in the field can be optimized with a smaller impact on the environment.
