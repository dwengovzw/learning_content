# Applying for jobs

Will people still apply for jobs in the classic way in the future? Probably not. <br>
Applying for jobs actually changed significantly when employers started screening prospective employees on social media. 

**Impact: New ways of applying for jobs**<br>

Digitization has already had quite an impact on job applications. Thanks to AI, you can receive interesting job openings in your inbox on some platforms. New forms of applying are emerging, such as the use of video interviews. Moreover, as an applicant you have to take profiling into account and the fact that what is posted on social media platforms can still be found
years later. 


## Principles of computational thinking

## Discussion of the impact
- Profiling is carried out based on social media posts and cover letters using artificial intelligence algorithms. For human resources, an applicant’s personality is of interest; after all, some types are better suited to certain roles than others (De Gussem & Daelemans, 2020).<br> 
Example: The Ghent-based company Traicie is working on an AI system that decides from cover letters to what extent the author is suitable for the job. To do so, the system infers personality traits from what the applicant wrote. 
- Thanks to AI, you can receive interesting job openings in your inbox on some platforms. 
But do you actually get to see all the job openings you’re interested in?<br>
Example: Until 2018, Amazon used a much-praised but since-discontinued AI system to evaluate applicants. The system did not select women for technical positions. That was because the system had been trained on historical data: applicants from the previous 10 years, mostly men since they still dominate the tech world. <br>
- Some companies, such as Unilever, use a video interview to recruit new staff. Those recordings are analyzed by an algorithm. It takes into account not only what the applicant says, but also, for example, facial expressions. Unilever says the system identifies the most motivated and suitable candidates for the job (Oostra, 2019; Wall Street Journal, 2018).<br>
- Companies that handle the application process with the help of AI often appeal to the **supposed** objectivity of those systems. But every AI system contains bias; these systems are always biased, which is due to how they are developed. The company Traicie also says it uses an unbiased system. Their AI system decides, based on cover letters, to what extent the author possesses the skills required for a particular job.
