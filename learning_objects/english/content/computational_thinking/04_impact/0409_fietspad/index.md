## Discussion of the impact

Smart street lighting can have a major impact on society:
-  Improved safety
    - Smart street lighting increases visibility on public roads, sidewalks, and bike paths, thereby improving the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists, especially at night or in poor weather conditions.
    - Lighting that becomes brighter when motion is detected can deter potential crimes and help reduce the number of accidents and street robberies 
-  Energy efficiency and cost savings
    - Smart street lighting uses LED technology and sensors to optimize energy consumption. Lighting can be dimmed or turned off when there is no traffic, resulting in significant energy savings and lower operational costs for cities and municipalities.
    - By reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions, smart street lighting contributes to sustainability and environmental protection efforts.
-  Improved urban planning
    - Data collected by smart street lighting systems, such as traffic patterns, crowding at certain locations, and environmental conditions, can be used for urban planning and infrastructure improvements.
    - Cities can use this data to optimize traffic flows, better design public spaces, and improve safety based on real-time information about the environment.
-  Smart City initiatives
    - Smart street lighting is often an integral part of broader Smart City initiatives, in which cities use advanced technologies to improve the quality of life for citizens.
    - These initiatives often include integrating lighting systems with other smart infrastructures, such as traffic management, waste management, and energy supply, to create a seamless and efficient urban environment
-  Improved user experience
    - Citizen experiences are enhanced by a better-lit environment, which increases the sense of safety and well-being.
    - For pedestrians and cyclists, the use of smart lighting can contribute to a more pleasant experience by adapting the lighting to their presence and movements
-  Data privacy and security
    - While smart street lighting offers benefits, it also raises questions about privacy and the security of personal data. The collection and analysis of data on traffic flows and movement patterns can contain sensitive information about individual citizens.
    - It is essential that cities and municipalities take appropriate measures to protect citizens' privacy and ensure that data is used and stored in a safe and ethical manner.

Smart street lighting can therefore have a large, positive impact on society; however, it is important to take into account the risks regarding privacy and security.
