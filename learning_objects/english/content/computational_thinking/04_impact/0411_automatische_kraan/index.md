# Automatic faucet

An automatic faucet is a very simple digital system that students themselves also regularly encounter. The societal impact lies in the positive influence on hygiene, limiting the spread of diseases, and reducing water consumption.

## Discussion of the impact
- These devices are easy to use. Because of their user-friendliness, they are widely used, which means the impact can be significant. Since you don’t have to touch the devices, they prevent users from being infected with viruses or bacteria and can help curb the spread of diseases among the population.
- The 'real' world is complex. Even this simple example illustrates that. These automatic faucets can be susceptible to contamination with the legionella bacterium. Because the water often flows only briefly, the bacterium has more opportunity to multiply. But technological solutions have already been devised for that as well, such as automatic flushing at fixed time intervals. In the debrief, focus on the interplay between the domain of science and society.
- Although these systems are sometimes called 'smart', no AI is involved. Realizing this is also part of AI literacy and critically engaging with information.
