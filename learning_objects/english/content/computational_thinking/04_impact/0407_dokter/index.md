# Should I see a doctor

Emergency departments and general practitioners are often overburdened. And it might just happen to you that you fall ill during the weekend. Should you contact the on-call GP service, go to the emergency department, or can you wait until Monday? <br>

**Impact: Digital application as an 'intermediate step' in patient-doctor contact**<br>
To address these problems, a digital application was developed: "Do I need to see a doctor?". <br>
If, for example, you become ill over the weekend, you answer the questions from "Do I need to see a doctor?" and at the end you receive appropriate advice.
The application works on the basis of a decision tree, but how do you represent labeled data from the healthcare sector in a way that is suitable for making decisions about a diagnosis or a treatment?<br>

## Principles of computational thinking

## Discussion of the impact

-  Reduced workload for the physician.
-  Patient well-being.
