<decomposition>
**Decomposition**<br>
1. Components: Self-checkout systems consist of hardware (such as scanners and payment terminals), software (for managing transactions and inventory), and user interfaces (touchscreens or mobile apps).
</decomposition>
<patternRecognition>
**Pattern recognition**<br>
Self-checkout systems use pattern recognition to identify products, retrieve prices, and carry out payment operations. They recognize barcodes, QR codes, and other patterns to facilitate transactions.<br>
- Identification of products, prices, and payment methods.
- Recognition of barcodes, QR codes, and payment processing patterns.
- Acceleration of payment processes and reduction of waiting times.

**Algorithmic thinking**<br>
Designing self-checkout systems requires algorithmic thinking to develop algorithms that optimize transactions, inventory management, and price calculations. It also includes the efficient processing of payments.
