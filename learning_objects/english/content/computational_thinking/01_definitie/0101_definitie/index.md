# Definition

What does computational thinking involve? This video gives you an introduction.  

![](@youtube/https://www.youtube.com/embed/QrE3dtHFwas "introductory video on the basic concepts of computational thinking") 

In the panel 'A definition of computational thinking' we present a definition that can serve as a starting point for Flemish teachers.<br> 
To arrive at this definition, we took into account the aspects of 'computational thinking' for which there is international consensus (see the next learning object 'Point of attention: Consensus') and the definition provided with the Flemish attainment targets for the first grade (see the bottom of this page).

    <strong><h5>A definition of computational thinking</h5></strong> 
    <em>Computational thinking is a methodology for tackling a complex problem in such a way that a computer could be deployed to solve it.</em><br>
    <br>
    <strong><h5>Four basic concepts</h5></strong>
    Computational thinking rests on <strong>four basic concepts</strong>:<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Decomposition</strong><br>
    Thoughtfully splitting a problem into well-chosen subproblems so that each part can be addressed separately and the problem’s solution can be obtained more easily.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Abstraction</strong><br>
    Ignoring information that is not needed to solve a problem. Hiding certain details in order to think about a problem in broad strokes.<br> 
    When tackling complex problems, abstraction is needed because reasoning proceeds more smoothly without the burden of irrelevant details. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Pattern recognition</strong><br> 
    Identifying that certain aspects of a problem exhibit similarities, allowing it to be simplified.<br> 
    Recognizing that a problem resembles a previously solved problem. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Algorithmic thinking</strong><br> 
    Making explicit a series of unambiguous instructions that must be executed step by step.<br> 
    Realizing that this series of instructions and their order are essential to produce the desired result.
</div> 

For a given problem, these basic concepts are often interwoven. Computational thinking involves properly understanding and formulating the problem to be solved, devising a solution, formulating an algorithm, and (if desired) implementing it on the computer.

An important aspect is recognizing problems for which the computer can indeed be used as a tool.

For some problems this is an efficient methodology to arrive at a solution, or this methodology makes it easier to use the computer to solve the problem. 
    
The term 'computer' is used in the broad sense of the word: the whole of hardware and software of computers, smartphones, tablets, and other information-processing systems.

The following video gives you an initial idea of what these basic concepts can mean in practice.

Since 2019 there have been compulsory minimum learning goals 'Computational thinking and acting' in Flemish education. In the principles accompanying the attainment targets of the first grade, a definition was also formulated—see the panel 'Definition of computational thinking and acting in the attainment targets'—and they described what is intended with it.<br>

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
    <strong><h5>Definition of computational thinking and acting in the attainment targets</h5></strong> 
    <h5>(AHOVOKS, 2020)</h5> 
    <em>Computational thinking and acting is a process by which one arrives at output using the following techniques: recognizing patterns (pattern recognition) and generalizing (generalization), dividing a problem into subproblems (decomposition), abstracting the data or the problem itself (abstraction), shaping the solution method (modeling), and following a fixed step-by-step plan (algorithms).</em> <br>
    <br>
    The idea was to not only teach students to use digital technology, but also to ensure that they understand the underlying workings.<br>
    <br>
    The learning goals concerning computational thinking aim to: 
    <ul>
        <li>give students better insight into complex problems;</li>
        <li>enable them to understand how a computer works so that they can "at a later stage use it as a tool to solve a problem";</li>
        <li>prepare students for life in a rapidly changing world and equip them to think critically about the impact that technology has on privacy, employment, and health.</li>
    </ul>
    This aligns with 21st-century competences, including problem-solving and digital competences, and with the need for digital competences in order to acquire the other 21st-century skills.
