# Introduction
Being able to think computationally is necessary to understand the digital world. Hence the introduction of the new attainment targets 'computational thinking and acting' in the first, second and third stage of Flemish secondary education. <br>
It may not yet be entirely clear to you what exactly computational thinking entails, and you may not yet be familiar with the new terminology. In that case, it is not straightforward to recognize the concepts and practices of computational thinking, let alone to apply them. Yet we often use computational thinking in our everyday lives, and it features abundantly, albeit implicitly, in many lessons.

    <strong>Required knowledge</strong><br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>In order to integrate computational thinking meaningfully into your existing lessons, as a teacher you need to know what the terminology entails, so a <em>workable 'definition'</em> is certainly required. Using <em>everyday examples</em>, the new terminology quickly becomes clear.</li>
        <li>It is necessary that you <em>recognize</em> possible applications, and that you have knowledge of possible <em>didactic approaches</em> and methods of assessment.</li>
        <li>Both activities <em>with or without a computer</em> can serve to learn to think computationally. Through unplugged activities, some complex concepts become more accessible. But for your students to fully understand digital systems, you will ultimately still need to take the step to using the computer.</li>
        <li>To address computational thinking at school with the right approach, it is important that, as a teacher, you are aware of certain <em>misconceptions</em>.</li>
    </ul>

In this learning path, a workable definition of the term 'computational thinking' is first presented. Under 'Points of attention', several misconceptions are explained, attention is drawn to the possible loss of the link with society, and the centrality of the human being within computational thinking is emphasized.
