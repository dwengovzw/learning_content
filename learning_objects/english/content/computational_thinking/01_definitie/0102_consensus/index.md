# Points of attention

## Consensus on the basic concepts

Computational thinking comprises quite a few concepts and practices. These concepts and practices are not perceived in the same way by everyone: the relevance of a particular aspect varies depending on the purpose for which someone wants to use computational thinking; a person's education also plays a role in this. What one person considers a concept of computational thinking may be regarded by another as an application of it. Moreover, the content of the term ‘computational thinking’ changes along with what computers can do. 
So not everyone understands the same thing by ‘computational thinking’, and the way someone applies computational thinking also differs (see also learning path ['History'](https://www.dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=ct7_historiek&language=nl&te=true&source_page=%2Fcomputational_thinking%2F&source_title=%20Computationeel%20Denken#ct_historiek1;nl;3)). 

Internationally, there is therefore no consensus on a definition of computational thinking. But research shows that there is consensus about certain concepts that underlie computational thinking, namely, **decomposition, generalization and pattern recognition, abstraction and algorithm** (Bocconi, 2016; Grover & Pea, 2017; Lodi, 2020; Lowe & Brophy, 2017; Selby & Woolard, 2013). 

> To be able to introduce computational thinking into education, it is best that the concept is clear. For Flemish education, a definition of computational thinking has been provided with the attainment targets of the first grade (see learning object 'Definition').

## Consensus on the misconceptions

However, there is also quite a bit of consensus about what computational thinking **not** is and what it **is**. Unfortunately, quite a few misconceptions are circulating. 

It is important that teachers are aware of these misconceptions.
