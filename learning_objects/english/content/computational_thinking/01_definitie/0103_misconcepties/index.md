# Misconceptions

**1. Computational thinking is not "thinking like a computer."**

Computational thinking is not "thinking like a computer" (computers don’t think), and although computer scientists are undoubtedly masters at it, for most people it is also not "thinking like a computer scientist." It is about being able to solve one’s own problems that one is confronted with, in an organized way(Hemmendinger, 2010; Barr & Stephenson, 2011; Denning & Tedre, 2019).

> The computer scientist Hemmendinger (2010) writes “Teaching computational thinking, however, is something else; not to lead people to think like us — which is pretty varied anyway. Instead, it is to teach them how to think like an economist, a physicist, an artist, and to understand how to use computation to solve their problems, to create, and to discover new questions that can fruitfully be explored.”


**2. Computational thinking is not always the best way of thinking, nor the best way to solve a problem.**

Computational thinking shows similarities with other ways of thinking, and cannot be labeled as the ‘best’ way of thinking; it is an extra way of thinking alongside critical thinking, systems thinking . . . (see also the learning path ['History'](https://www.dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=ct7_historiek&language=nl&te=true&source_page=%2Fcomputational_thinking%2F&source_title=%20Computationeel%20Denken#ct_historiek1;nl;3)).<br>
Computational thinking is by no means the ‘best’ way to solve problems (Tedre & Denning, 2016; Papert, 1980). The nature of the problem also helps determine which approach is best. For some problems, however, computational thinking is the only way to solve them. 

Computational thinking does provide a foothold for tackling a complex problem and devising a way to arrive at a solution to that problem using the computer. For example, some solutions are unfeasible for humans, but computers can carry them out thanks to their speed. 

Computational thinking is therefore also about seeing the opportunities that the computer offers for conducting scientific research, other research or more efficient research, and sensing opportunities to automate tasks.


**3. Computational thinking is not the same as ICT.**

Computational thinking is not the same as ICT, which in practice often amounts to merely working with applications, such as word processing or designing a simple web page. Computational thinking is about practices such as representing data; looking for the most efficient solution to a problem is also inherent to computational thinking (Voogt et al., 2015). 


**4. Computational thinking is not the same as programming.**
    
There is broad consensus that computational thinking and programming are not the same, and that programming is not the most important aspect either. The digitalization of society is about much more than programming. It has changed our worldview (Wing, 2006; Papert, 1980; Tedre & Denning, 2016; Bocconi et al., 2016; Grover & Pea, 2017).

That does not detract from the fact that programming can be a good way to learn to think computationally (Bocconi et al., 2016; Grover & Pea, 2017) and can be a means for creative expression (Voogt et al., 2015; Mishra & Yadav, 2013; European Union, 2015). However, programming alone is not sufficient to learn to think computationally. 

Introducing computational thinking into compulsory education is by no means intended to turn everyone into programmers or computer scientists, but to acquire the basic skills of computational thinking and to explore what they mean for the various disciplines, and if necessary to even temporarily decouple computational thinking from computer science (think, for example, of activities without a computer, the unplugged examples) (Hemmendinger, 2010; Barr & Stephenson, 2011). <br>


**4. Computational thinking is not only interesting for programmers and other computer scientists.**

Almost every science, both the exact and the human sciences, nowadays has a computational branch. In more and more professions one must use the computer. Increasingly, services from the government, banks and insurance companies, public transport ... are digital.  


**5. You don’t learn computational thinking only unplugged.**

One can also work on computational thinking without a computer. ‘Unplugged’ often makes complicated concepts more accessible as well. But that too is not sufficient to learn to think computationally: to fully understand digital systems, for example, programming will also have to come into play (Bell & Lodi, 2019).

> People sometimes wrongly assume that one can think computationally without any understanding of the technical side of computers and the possibilities and limitations that come with them (Denning & Tedre, 2019).<br>

> If computational thinking is addressed in non-computer science lessons, or for example through unplugged activities, then the link with the computer should be made explicit if one wants to achieve a transfer from the activity to understanding in computer science. Research shows that the popular 'CS Unplugged' is best presented linked to contemporary technology (Bell, 2018).

Although you do not always need a computer to acquire certain skills of computational thinking, the focus should ultimately be the computer (Barr & Stephenson, 2011). Otherwise the link with the digital society would also be hard to find. It should not be forgotten that digital skills, including computational thinking, receive so much attention precisely in order to function in today’s society and to understand the impact of digitalization on society. Some therefore warn against seeing computational thinking as too detached from the computer (Denning & Tedre, 2019; Berry, 2019; Lodi, 2020). 


**6. Computational thinking is not a generic skill that is simply transferred.**

Voices are calling for computational thinking to be offered cross-curricularly, in relevant real-world contexts, especially given the link with 21st-century skills (Grover & Pea, 2017). Voogt et al. (2015) warn against placing too much emphasis in lessons on computational thinking on acquiring skills such as perseverance, being able to collaborate, and being able to deal with complexity and ambiguity. That could lead to the work on the computational thinking skill itself getting lost.

You can read more about this in the next learning object 'Points of attention: Transfer".


**7. Computational thinking is not a purely technological phenomenon.**

Using computers is also a social activity that requires taking into account their role in society. Computational thinking is about people. 

> Computational thinking is not only about technology, but also has a cultural and social dimension (Kafai & Proctor, 2022).
