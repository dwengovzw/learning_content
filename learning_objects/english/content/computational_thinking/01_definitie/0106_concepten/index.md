# Concepts and practices

## Common concepts, practices and skills

Computational thinking encompasses quite a few concepts and practices.

On the poster you can see concepts of computational thinking and approaches. This list of concepts, practices and skills is not exhaustive. For example, it is noticeable that 'modelling' is missing from the list. 

> In the definition in the principles of the attainment targets for the first stage, modelling is explicitly mentioned (see Learning path ['Attainment targets'](https://www.dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=ct8_eindtermen&language=nl&te=true&source_page=%2Fcomputational_thinking%2F&source_title=%20Computationeel%20denken#ct06_00;nl;3)).

There is international consensus on the four basic concepts 'decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction and algorithm'. Which other concepts and practices are cited tends to vary quite a bit depending on who it is, that person's background, and what they use computational thinking for. (You read about this earlier in the learning object 'Point of attention: Consensus'.)
