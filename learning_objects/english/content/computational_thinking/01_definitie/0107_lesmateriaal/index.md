# Teaching materials

Computational thinking can enter your lessons in many ways. The existing curriculum offers plenty of opportunities to get started with computational thinking. 

- Researchers from all over the world have already published a great deal about this.
- We also make the computational thinking present in our teaching materials as explicit as possible.

We have collected these examples. You can find them in the learning path ['Examples'](https://www.dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=ct3_voorbeelden&language=nl&te=true&source_page=%2Fcomputational_thinking%2F&source_title=%20Computationeel%20Denken#ct_inleiding_voorbeelden;nl;3). 

Concrete lesson examples of computational thinking are developed in the learning path ['Cases'](https://www.dwengo.org/learning-path.html?hruid=ct6_cases&language=nl&te=true&source_page=%2Fcomputational_thinking%2F&source_title=%20Computationeel%20Denken#ct_cases0;nl;3). 

The video below briefly explains how Dwengo integrates computational thinking into STEM projects or into mathematics lessons.
