# Points of attention

## Transfer
Unfortunately, it is often proclaimed, but claiming that computational thinking is a skill students will automatically apply everywhere is not a good idea. **Transfer does not happen by itself**, but must explicitly be part of instruction (Bocconi et al., 2016; Tedre & Denning, 2016; Guzdial, 2015). Within education research, transferring knowledge from one subject area to another, and from theory to practice, is one of the main challenges. It is known that students find it difficult to transfer material learned in one subject to another domain. Ideally, students can carry their insights over to new contexts inside and outside the classroom, but that is sometimes too ambitious (Kober et al., 2015).

A distinction is made between 'near' and 'far' transfer. 

* **Near transfer** refers to applying knowledge learned in one context to a similar context.

* **Far transfer** concerns applying knowledge learned in one context to a substantially different context, for example transfer from one STEM discipline to another, or from the classroom to the ‘real world’.

There are factors believed to **promote transfer**, such as practicing within a context, making similarities explicit, and gaining deeper insight into the concepts (Honey et al., 2014).

* Because we can more easily retrieve learned concepts that are connected to each other compared to concepts that are not connected, integration could be effective.

* By explicitly pointing students to the possibilities for transfer, e.g., by pointing out similarities between two problems or referring to an underlying concept, the likelihood of transfer increases. Being able to represent the same concept in multiple ways and across different disciplines can also promote learning.

* Good use of a mathematical representation can partly determine how well students grasp scientific concepts. Being able to represent the same concept in multiple ways and across different disciplines can also promote learning. It is therefore important that students can translate representations of concepts from one discipline to another. 


> **Dwengo’s teaching materials reinforce the transfer of knowledge and skills from the classroom to the real world by working with lifelike contexts.** We take into account insights from scientific research.<br>
> - Deeper understanding can also be achieved by increasing students’ interest in the subject matter and boosting their motivation to learn, precisely by working with socially relevant contexts (Honey et al., 2014).<br>
> - There is evidence that offering subject matter within integrated STEM projects can deepen students’ knowledge. By also expressing concepts from science mathematically, they become more widely applicable. It is best to make the connections between the disciplines explicit and to pay attention to the individual disciplines. However, keep in mind that more integration is not necessarily better (Honey et al., 2014; Pearson, 2017). There are indications that mathematics benefits the least from integrated STEM projects (Honey et al., 2014), but contexts are motivating and help clarify abstract concepts for students. The Dwengo teaching materials take this into account by offering applications that potentially strengthen understanding of mathematics already learned.<br>
> - Thoughtful use of computational tools and skills can help to better understand the subject matter of mathematics and science. Conversely, mathematics and science can provide meaningful contexts in which to apply computational thinking (Weintrop et al., 2016). Within an integrated STEM project, the interplay between mathematics/science and computational thinking—and, conversely, between computational thinking and mathematics/science—can be highlighted.<br>
For example, by using digital models, concepts can be visualized and simulated, which can lead to greater insight (Weintrop et al., 2016).<br>
> - The language spoken across the various STEM disciplines is not the same. To enable students to transfer knowledge and skills between different STEM disciplines, it will be important to state explicitly which concepts align with each other and which notations are used for similar concepts (Honey et al., 2014).<br>
> - More abstract representations, symbols, and graphs can help place matters from different domains side by side. In this, we specifically draw connections between (new) concepts from computer science and concepts from science, technology, and mathematics.
> - By working across subjects with a project from ‘AI Op School’, teachers not only make connections between the different STEM disciplines, but, through the specific contexts, also work on media literacy, citizenship, or culture. In addition, they become familiar with practices for incorporating such atypical topics into their lessons. *‘KIKS’ is, for example, structured in such a way that students virtually step into the scientist’s shoes.*<br> Both STEM teachers and teachers of religion/ethics and the humanities can draw inspiration from the ‘AI Op School’ teaching materials in this context. We provide many concrete examples with which teachers of religion/ethics and social subjects can also work on AI topics. Mathematics and science teachers can also draw on ‘AI Op School’ for material to work with their students on research competencies or to integrate programming into their lessons. <br>In the projects of ‘AI Op School’, the setting is a ‘temporary’ setting that is socially relevant and in which students encounter certain concepts of artificial intelligence for the first time. The setting determines which items are covered and which terminology and knowledge the students will acquire. *In ‘KIKS’, in the setting of plants and climate change, students become familiar with the AI technique of deep learning.* <br> *It is important that, when carrying out an ‘AI Op School’ project, the terminology and knowledge acquired are also applied in other contexts, such as recognizing handwritten digits and the self-driving car. When students, for example, have become acquainted with the bias in KIKS’s neural network, it is important that bias in other AI systems is also discussed, e.g., those used for HR or the fight against crime.* <br>
>- The complexity of the practical cases should of course not distract students from the learning objectives (Honey et al., 2014). That is why we build up all knowledge step by step within modules. <br>
>- The interdisciplinary character of ‘AI Op School’ involves an active link between the modules and the different subject didactics. Specifically, we see links with the subject didactics of
engineering & technology, computer science, mathematics, biology, bioscience engineering, and social sciences. <br>*Engineering is, for example, already present in the ‘KIKS’ project in the form of designing the architecture of a neural network, starting from the very first network inspired by the human brain (link between biology and engineering), through to populating the dataset and taking into account the limits of computing power. Technology also appears here in biology in the form of a microscopy lab practical on photosynthesis.*
