# Conclusion
In Flemish education, the following concepts of computational thinking were given a place: decomposition, pattern recognition and generalization, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking. 

However, it is clear that the attainment targets/minimum goals go beyond the four basic concepts of computational thinking and aim for a basic knowledge of computer science. After all, it is also about computational practices.

The educational goals include basic knowledge of digital systems and working with digital tools.
-  Debugging and principles of programming languages, modeling and simulating, and digital representation of information.
-  The goal is for students to understand how digital systems work and, in time, also see when they can use the computer in a meaningful way, e.g., when solving a problem or trying to extract information from data.
- Students can function better as critical citizens in the digitized world.
- Computational thinking is not the same as programming and is broader than problem-solving. It is also about seeing when a computer can be used; this may be when solving a problem, but also when automating a process or processing and visualizing data.

The rationale for these new attainment targets can be found in the need for 21st-century competencies. Computational thinking is internationally regarded as a foundation for digital competencies, one of the 21st-century competencies (Voogt et al., 2013; Yadav et al., 2017a, Li et al., 2020).<br>
Digital competencies themselves are regarded as a way to acquire and assess the other 21st-century competencies. That is the main reason why countries are introducing computational thinking in education. The European Union also endorses the importance of 21st-century competencies and the role that computational thinking can play in them.<br>
Teachers should not lose sight of the higher goal of these learning objectives.

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
The attainment targets for computational thinking are situated not only within the key competence ‘Digital competence and media literacy’, but also within the
key competence ‘Competencies in mathematics, the natural sciences and technology’ and within the key competence ‘Learning competencies’.
Given the link with 21st-century competencies, such as media literacy and information literacy, computational thinking can also be addressed and is even important in non-STEM subjects.
