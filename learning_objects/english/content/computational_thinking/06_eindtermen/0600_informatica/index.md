# The need for computer science classes at school

## Call

For several decades, computer science was almost absent from the course offerings of Flemish education (wyffels et al., 2014). <br>
In 2014, the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts (KVAB) issued a call to make computer science compulsory in the curriculum. 
In their 2014 report ‘Computer Sciences in Compulsory Education’, the KVAB argues that "every young person must become 'computer-proficient, digitally literate' and be able to think 'computationally'."

> "After all, all children must be able to keep up with the rapid technological evolution of computing. To do so, they must learn to understand the underlying workings of computing, and gain insight into the concepts that underpin these technologies. Moreover, it is necessary that enough young people can steer this technological evolution, which means that they are able and motivated to create new technologies," according to the KVAB report (Samaey et al., 2014).

The KVAB calls computational thinking “the human capacity to solve complex problems while seeing computers as a tool (by formulating these solutions in such a way that computers can be used to carry them out)” and further describes it as “the process by which aspects of computer science are recognized in the world around us, and by which the methods and techniques from computer science are applied to understand and solve problems from the physical and virtual world”.<br>
In this formulation, the Academy inextricably links computational thinking with computer science. It sees computational thinking as a form of problem-solving thinking, but with a concrete computer-oriented interpretation: “computational thinking results in a computer program or a robot that actually works” (Samaey et al., 2014).

> For the Academy, computational thinking therefore always leads to the implementation of a solution in a computer system.

## New educational goals since 2019

**In Flemish education, new attainment targets and minimum goals have recently been formulated for secondary education, with the aim of future-oriented education that takes into account the challenges of the 21st century.** 

The text of the KVAB did not miss its mark and was one of the reference frameworks for the reform of Flemish secondary education regarding digital skills. **The learning objectives of digital competencies were expanded with the concepts of computational thinking and with the foundations of computer science.**
