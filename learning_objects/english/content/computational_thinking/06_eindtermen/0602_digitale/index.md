# Attainment targets and minimum goals 'Digital competence and media literacy'

## Digital competence and media literacy

As mentioned earlier, the attainment targets and minimum goals are divided across 16 key competences, such as ‘Digital competence and media literacy’, ‘Learning competences’ and ‘Competences in mathematics, the sciences and technology’. 

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
<strong>The three building blocks of the key competence ‘Digital competence and media literacy’</strong>
<ul><li><strong>‘Digital media and applications to create, participate and interact’</strong>
    <ul><li>The building block about the use of information and communication technology.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>This addresses digital developments and the importance of basic knowledge and proper use of ICT in order to participate in society.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>This building block is connected with attainment targets and minimum goals around information literacy (learning objectives about acquiring and managing information; these belong to the key competence on learning competences).</li></ul>
    <ul><li>In the formulation of these attainment targets, explicit reference is made to creating, sharing and collaborating, and thus they have a clear link with 21st‑century skills.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Examples: the use of online tools, creating digital content, and digital citizenship.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li><strong>‘Computational thinking and acting’</strong>
    <ul><li>The building block that aims for “basic knowledge and skills in the field of computer science.”</li></ul>
    <ul><li>This building block also aims to promote problem-solving thinking, for example. </li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li><strong>‘Dealing with digital and non-digital media and information in a responsible, critical and ethical way’</strong>
    <ul><li>The building block on media literacy.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>This building block is about, among other things, the impact of technological development on society and the associated ethical aspects.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>This building block should also strengthen critical thinking. In the attainment targets formulated for this building block, for example, attention is also paid to visual literacy, which is important for dealing critically with various media.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</div>

> With the attainment targets comes a definition of computational thinking and acting; you will find this definition in the next part of the learning path.

> Computational thinking and media literacy belong to the same key competence; this reflects their complementarity and overlap, as noted by Gretter & Yadav (2016).

## Some examples of attainment targets and minimum goals of ‘Computational thinking and acting’

The following boxes ‘Some attainment targets on computational thinking’ and ‘Knowledge concerning computational thinking’ provide some examples of attainment targets, basic literacy attainment targets and minimum goals from the building block ‘Computational thinking and acting’, and the expected knowledge that goes with them. 

> For the first stage, ‘computational thinking and acting’ even received the status of basic literacy. That means that every individual student must achieve those learning objectives.

<div class="alert alert-box alert-warning">
<strong>Some attainment targets on computational thinking and acting</strong> (AHOVOKS, 2020)<br>
<strong>For the first stage:</strong><br>
<ul><li> 4.3 Students distinguish building blocks of digital systems. (understanding)</li></ul>
<ul><li> 4.4 Students apply a simple self-designed algorithm to solve a problem digitally and non-digitally. (analysing)</li></ul>
<strong>Basic literacy:</strong><br>
<ul><li> BG 4.3 The student recognises building blocks of digital systems in functional contexts. (remembering)</li></ul>
<ul><li> BG 4.4 The student applies a provided algorithm in functional contexts to solve a problem digitally and non-digitally. (applying)</li></ul>
<strong>For the second stage (annulled):</strong><br>
<ul><li> 4.4 Students explain how building blocks of digital systems relate to and interact with each other. (understanding)</li></ul>
<br>
Depending on the study track, supplemented with:
<ul><li> 4.5 (labour market finality) Students solve a defined problem digitally by adapting a provided algorithm. (creating)</li></ul>
<br>
or with:
<ul><li> 4.5 (dual finality or further study finality) Students design algorithms to solve problems digitally. (creating)</li></ul>
<strong>New minimum goal for the second stage:</strong><br>
<ul><li> 04.05 Students analyse the impact of digital systems on society from principles of computational thinking.</li></ul>

<div class="alert alert-box alert-warning">
<strong>Knowledge concerning computational thinking (first version of the new attainment targets)</strong> (AHOVOKS)<br> 
The knowledge students have to acquire concerning computational thinking consists, among other things, of: 
<ul><li>decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, algorithm; </li></ul>
<ul><li>modelling and simulation;</li></ul> 
<ul><li>input–processing–output; </li></ul>
<ul><li>testing and debugging;</li></ul> 
<ul><li>digital representation of information; 
    <ul><li>binary representation; </li></ul>
    <ul><li>data format; </li></ul>
    <ul><li>relationship between analogue and digital representation; </li></ul> </li></ul>
<ul><li>principles and elements of programming languages, such as
    <ul><li>sequence, iteration structure, selection structure;</li></ul>
    <ul><li>variables, data types, operators, functions; </li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li>operating system; </li></ul>
<ul><li>hardware; </li></ul>
<ul><li>applications such as word processing and games; </li></ul>
