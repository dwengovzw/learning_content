# Definition of computational thinking

Besides the new learning objectives, a definition of 'Computational thinking and acting' was also formulated and it was described what is intended with this building block; see the box 'Definition of computational thinking in the attainment targets'. 

<div class="alert alert-box alert-secondary">
<strong><h5>Definition of computational thinking in the attainment targets</h5></strong> 
<h5>(AHOVOKS, 2020)</h5> 

_Computational thinking and acting is a process by which one arrives at output using the following techniques: recognizing patterns (pattern recognition) and generalizing (generalization), dividing a problem into subproblems (decomposition), abstracting from the data or the problem itself (abstraction), shaping the solution method (modeling), and following a fixed step-by-step plan (algorithms)._ 

The intention was to have students "not only learn to use digital technology, but also to ensure that they understand how it works internally".<br>
The learning objectives on computational thinking aim to: 
<ul><li>give students better insight into complex problems;</li></ul>
<ul><li>enable them to understand how a computer works so that they "can later deploy it as a tool to solve a problem";</li></ul>
<ul><li>prepare students for life in a rapidly changing world and equip them to think critically about the impact that technology has on privacy, employment, and health.</li></ul>
    
<em>This aligns with 21st-century skills, of which problem-solving is one, and with the need for digital skills to be able to acquire the other 21st-century skills.</em>    
</div> 

Taking into account the proposed definition and the international consensus surrounding the term 'computational thinking', we propose in the box 'A definition of computational thinking' a definition of our own that can serve as a starting point for Flemish teachers.<br>  

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
<strong><h5>A definition of computational thinking</h5></strong> 
    
_Computational thinking is a methodology for tackling a complex problem in such a way that a computer could be used to solve it._    

Computational thinking rests on four basic concepts: decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition, and algorithmic thinking.
    
For a given problem these basic concepts are often intertwined. Computational thinking involves understanding and formulating the problem to be solved, devising a solution, establishing an algorithm and (if desired) implementing it on the computer.

An important aspect is recognizing problems for which the computer can indeed be used as a tool.

For some problems this is an efficient methodology to arrive at a solution, or this methodology makes it easier to employ the computer to solve the problem. 
    
The term 'computer' is used in the broad sense of the word: the entirety of hardware and software of computers, smartphones, tablets, and other information-processing systems. 
</div>
    
The basic concepts are not clarified in the principles underpinning the attainment targets. We define the basic concepts in the following box.

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
<strong>Decomposition</strong><br> 
Thoughtfully split a problem into well-chosen subproblems, so that each part can be addressed separately and a solution to the problem is obtained more easily. 

<strong>Abstraction</strong><br>
Ignoring information that is not needed to solve a problem. Hiding certain details in order to think about a problem in broad terms.<br> 
When tackling complex problems, abstraction is needed because reasoning proceeds more smoothly without the ballast of irrelevant details. 

<strong>Pattern recognition</strong><br> 
Determining that certain aspects of a problem show similarities, thereby allowing it to be simplified.<br> 
Recognizing that a problem resembles a previously solved problem. 

<strong>Algorithmic thinking</strong><br> 
Making explicit a series of unambiguous instructions that must be carried out step by step.<br> 
Realizing that this series of instructions and their order are essential to deliver the desired result.
