# 21st-century competencies

The rationale behind these new learning outcomes lies in the need for 21st-century competencies. Computational thinking is internationally regarded as a **foundation for digital competencies**, one of the 21st-century competencies (Voogt et al., 2013; Yadav et al., 2017a, Li et al. , 2020).<br>
**Digital competencies themselves are considered a way to acquire and assess the other 21st-century competencies.** That is the main reason why countries are introducing computational thinking in education. The European Union also endorses the importance of 21st-century competencies and the role that computational thinking can play in them.<br>
Teachers should not lose sight of the higher goal of these learning objectives.
