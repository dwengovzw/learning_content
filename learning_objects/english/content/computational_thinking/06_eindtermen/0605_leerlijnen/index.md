# Attainment targets

## Learning pathways

The attainment targets that address digital skills, and in particular computational thinking, constitute vertical learning pathways (from the first up to and including the sixth year of secondary education) for:
* Digital applications:
    * a learning pathway around creating, sharing, collaborating, communicating, participating and interacting by means of digital applications;
    * a learning pathway around ICT use in certain subjects.
Digital systems and systems in general.
* Information literacy:
    * a learning pathway for acquiring and processing information;
    * a learning pathway for data literacy;
    * a learning pathway for modeling and simulation.
* Media literacy.
* Problem solving.
* Communicating about the solution to a problem.
* Algorithms.
* Logic.

The STEM attainment targets prioritize an integrated STEM. This offers opportunities to develop a horizontal learning pathway, in which collaboration within the teaching team, across subjects, is prioritized. <br>
In STEM projects where the different disciplines reinforce each other, STEM attainment targets can be addressed in a cross-curricular way.<br>
Given the generally socially relevant contexts of these projects, attainment targets of non-STEM subjects can also be meaningfully covered; themes such as ethics and media literacy lend themselves particularly well to this. To communicate about a solution to the central problem of these projects or to implement this solution on the computer, skills in communication, collaboration, ICT and programming are often taught or strengthened.<br>
These projects also offer ample opportunities to work on learning competencies, both in horizontal and vertical learning pathways.
