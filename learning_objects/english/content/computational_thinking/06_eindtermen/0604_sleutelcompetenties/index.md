# Other key competences

**Besides the attainment targets in the key competence ‘Digital competence and media literacy’, there are other attainment targets related to digital skills, and in particular to computational thinking.**

Information literacy is also a digital competence when working with digital sources. <br>
**Information literacy** is included in another key competence, **‘Learning competences’**. This key competence also contains attainment targets related to 21st-century skills, such as self-regulation, collaboration, communication and problem-solving (which are also linked to computational thinking).

* For the first stage:
** For the first stage, information literacy falls under the building block ‘Using appropriate (learning) activities, strategies and tools to acquire, manage and process information critically in digital and non-digital ways, taking into account the intended learning outcome and process’. This building block contains learning objectives that require digital skills and computational thinking. <br>
** Digital skills and computational thinking are also needed for another building block of this key competence, namely ‘Exploring a (research) problem and seeking an answer or solution using appropriate (learning) activities, strategies and tools’. An example of such an attainment target is “Students carry out a research technique step by step to obtain digital and non-digital data in function of a research question.” Possible research techniques mentioned include taking a measurement and developing an algorithm.<br>


The key competence **‘Competences in mathematics, science and technology’** contains attainment targets for the first stage and (specific) minimum goals for the second and third stages regarding mathematical skills and STEM, which lend themselves well to acquiring digital and computational skills. This ranges from using ICT tools, through mathematical modelling, to maintaining a computer.
* For the first stage A-stream: the attainment target "Students go through a problem-solving process in which knowledge and skills from multiple STEM disciplines are applied in an integrated way" lists among the knowledge items "identification of subproblems", i.e. decomposition, and "evaluation and adjustment".
* For the second stage, labour market finality: the (annulled) attainment target "Students systematically go through the problem-solving process in function of a problem statement" lists "algorithm" among the knowledge items.
* Second stage, transition and dual finality: the (annulled) attainment target "Students apply a scientific method to develop knowledge and to answer questions" lists among the knowledge items "defining and delineating the problem statement, observing and collecting data, analysing displayed data, communicating about the results".
* Second stage, transition and dual finality: The minimum goal "Students conduct research using a scientific method to develop knowledge and to answer questions" now does not specify knowledge, which means that the required knowledge is clear from the wording of the minimum goal. The annulled attainment targets can help here to clarify the knowledge. 
* For the third stage: the specific minimum goal, for some tracks of technical education, "Students develop a solution to a problem by applying STEM disciplines in an integrated way" mentions "modelling" among the knowledge elements. This minimum goal is an attainment target that was not annulled. In the first version of the minimum learning goals, the knowledge included, among other things: testing and evaluation, models, iterative process, applying computational skills such as programming and modelling and simulating using ICT.


The five areas of the European ‘DigComp 2.1’ within digital competences (information and data literacy, communication and collaboration, creating digital content, problem solving and safety) are clearly reflected in the attainment targets.
