# Flemish attainment targets and minimum goals

Flemish secondary education was recently reformed with newly defined educational objectives.
- These [attainment targets and minimum goals](https://onderwijsdoelen.be/) list the minimally achievable learning goals.
- They represent a measurable standard as a basis for curricula to be developed.
- The learning content, the learning activities, and the assessment of the students must be aligned with these, but the government does not prescribe how schools should achieve this.

> Schools are therefore free to offer the attainment targets and minimum goals within a subject, across multiple subjects, or, for example, through a project week. Schools also determine for themselves which learning content they use for this, although they receive guidelines about this from the educational providers GO!, KOV, POV, OVSG or OKO.

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
The attainment targets came into effect in the first year of secondary education in September 2019 and are being further implemented year by year in the other grades. In September 2023, the minimum goals will start in the fifth year.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-box alert-secondary">
<strong>A turbulent journey</strong><br>
On June 16, 2022, the Constitutional Court annulled the new attainment targets for the second and third stage of secondary education.
<ul><li>The first version of the new attainment targets explicitly mentioned the expected factual knowledge and the associated conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive knowledge.</li></ul>
<ul><li>In addition, the mastery level of these minimal learning goals was specified according to the revised Bloom’s taxonomy.<br><em>For more explanation about the revised Bloom’s taxonomy, see ‘A taxonomy for learning, teaching, and assessing: A revision of Bloom’s taxonomy of educational objectives’ by Anderson and Krathwohl (2001).</em></li></ul>
Meanwhile, these annulled attainment targets have been replaced by new minimum goals for the second and third stage.
<ul><li>The aim was fewer and less detailed goals, with the required knowledge clearly indicated.</li></ul>
<ul><li>They moved away from Bloom’s taxonomy.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The required mastery level can be inferred from the action verb in the minimum goal.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The attainment targets for the first stage are also being reviewed again.</li></ul>
<ul><li>For more explanation about the mastery level in the attainment targets/minimum goals, see the learning object ‘Action verbs’.</li></ul>

You can find the new minimum goals [here](https://onderwijsdoelen.be/).

## Digital competence and media literacy

The attainment targets and minimum goals are divided across 16 key competences. One of the key competences is ‘Digital competence and media literacy’.

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
<strong>‘Digital competence and media literacy’</strong> is based on “addressing digital developments and the importance of basic knowledge and proper use of ICT in order to participate in society" (AHOVOKS, 2020). <br>
<strong>‘Computational thinking and acting’</strong> is one of the building blocks of this key competence. Internationally, computational thinking is regarded as a foundation for digital competences (Voogt et al., 2013; Yadav et al., 2017a, Li et al., 2020).<br>
Given the interconnectedness of the digital with all our lives, it is beyond doubt that the key competence ‘Digital competence and media literacy’ is not separate from the other fifteen key competences.
</div>

> The key competences are:
> - competences in the area of physical, mental and emotional awareness and in the area of physical, mental and emotional health;
> - competences in Dutch;
> - competences in other languages;
> - digital competence and media literacy;
> - social-relational competences;
> - competences in mathematics, the exact sciences and technology;
> - citizenship competences, including competences regarding living together;
> - competences related to historical awareness;
> - competences related to spatial awareness;
> - competences in sustainability;
> - economic and financial competences;
> - legal competences;
> - learning competences including research competences, innovation thinking, creativity, problem-solving and critical thinking, systems thinking, information processing and collaboration;
> - self-awareness and self-expression, self-direction and agility;
> - development of initiative, ambition, entrepreneurship and career competences;
> - cultural awareness and cultural expression.

> The [principles](onderwijsdoelen.be/uitgangspunten/4814) for the attainment targets and minimum goals further explain that the attainment targets for digital competence are related to most key competences.

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
In short, since September 2019, ‘computational thinking and acting’ has been part of the compulsory curriculum for all students in secondary education. For middle school students (first stage of secondary education), ‘computational thinking and acting’ even received the status of <strong>basic literacy</strong>, which means that every individual student must achieve the set objectives.
