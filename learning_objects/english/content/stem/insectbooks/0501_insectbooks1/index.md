# Modeling a caterpillar outbreak

This teaching material is made available to teachers who wish to get started with the renewed minimum goals for mathematics and computer science in the third stage transfer-oriented track. Six learning objects are provided:

- Exponential growth
- Logistic growth
- Chaos explained
- The Leslie matrix
- The finite difference method
- Differential equations

The teacher is free to choose which learning objects are or are not covered. To help the teacher make this choice, each learning object comes with additional information: a summary of the most important mathematical concepts covered, an overview of programming-specific elements used, and the minimum goals addressed.

## Study tracks

This module can be used in the following subjects in the third stage transfer-oriented track:

- Economics–Mathematics
- Greek–Mathematics
- Latin–Mathematics
- Technological Sciences and Engineering
- Science–Mathematics
- Biotechnological and Chemical STEM Sciences
- Computer and Communication Sciences
- Mechatronics
- Business Support Computer Science
- Business Sciences (GO!)

## Method

The interactive notebook provides many assignments for the students, in which they pursue various minimum goals. It is important to ensure that enough laptops or computers are available: preferably one device per student. A room that is large enough is preferred, so students have the freedom to work and the teacher has enough space to move around and answer students’ questions.

Based on recent research, it is recommended to have students work in pairs on the various assignments, with a healthy mix of students with and without prior programming experience. Preferably, the teacher is mindful to ensure that students who mainly wish to work alone get the chance to do so by pairing them with students who have a similar preference. They can still consult, but also get the chance to work individually. Note that the latter is also possible for students who collaborate more: both students can type individually on their own laptop or computer, so that they both work on the skill of programming. The final choice of one or two devices per pair of students lies with the teacher, who can take into account the available equipment.

## Assessment

To assess whether the students have achieved the minimum goals, there are several options:

- The teacher confines themselves to this notebook and asks the students to export the notebooks to a PDF file. This file can then be submitted online (e.g., via Smartschool) and assessed by the teacher.

- The teacher provides a second notebook with extra exercises, in which a new problem based on exponential growth is stated. Existing assignments can be reused, specifically applied to the new problem. Students may optionally use the code they implemented earlier; after all, a programmer would do the same.

The teacher can use a rubric for the assessment, which is shared with the students in advance. This makes it immediately clear to them which aspects are important for their learning process. It is also a useful tool for the teacher, which can help make the assessment process efficient and transparent. An example of a rubric, covering the first three learning objects, can be found below.
