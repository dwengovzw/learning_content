# Minimum Goals and Final Objectives

Within the KIKS project, a considerable number of learning objectives can be addressed. Some components of KIKS align with the minimum goals of the second grade, while others align with those of the third grade. The teacher determines which learning objectives are worked on with the project.
In the minimum goals and curricula, numerous learning objectives can be found that link KIKS with **biology, geography, chemistry, and mathematics**. Working on the **STEM** minimum goals is also possible within the KIKS project. We are currently establishing links to the new minimum goals.

KIKS also contains learning content that is suitable for working on the second grade's minimum goals of **media literacy** and the specific minimum goals of **informatics sciences in the third grade**. It's possible that your school has already started working towards these minimum goals of informatics sciences in the second grade.

*The final objectives from before the reform related to KIKS, and some of the curriculum objectives from that time of the GO!, Catholic Education Flanders, and the OVSG, can be found in the last part of this learning path.*
