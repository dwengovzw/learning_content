# Stomata and Climate Change 

**The water and CO<sub>2</sub> cycles of the world are affected by the transpiration of terrestrial plants. Therefore, it can be said that stomata have a global impact, an impact on the entire world. Most transpiration by vegetation occurs in the warm forested regions of the tropics** (see Figure) (Hetherington & Woodward, 2003). The tropical rainforests are located in areas near the equator. They are found in Central and South America, Africa, Asia, and the islands around Australia. **It is important to understand how plants will adjust this transpiration to the current climate change.** Scientists are also researching how the current climate change is affecting the formation of stomata.

A changing climate impacts biodiversity, and conversely, **biodiversity** can also affect climate change. For example, transpiration not only cools the plant but also its environment. There are significant differences in how plants respond to the increase in CO<sub>2</sub> and in the extent to which plants capture CO<sub>2</sub>.<br>
For example, it is crucial to gain insight into the adaptations of crops to be able to monitor the **food supply**.
