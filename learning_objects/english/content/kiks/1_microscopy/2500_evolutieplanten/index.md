# Evolution of plants and their stomata 
**Fossil leaves provide a lot of information about the evolution of plants and their stomata.** Four hundred million years ago, stomata first appeared in plants. Since then, they have evolved: noticeable changes have occurred, including differences in size and density of the stomata (see Figure 1) (Hetherington & Woodward, 2003). **Many plants have evolved in such a way that the leaf area occupied by stomata (s.d) is as small as possible** (Assouline & Or, 2013; Franks & Beerling, 2009).

The plants have evolved so that the leaf area taken up (<em>s.d</em>) is as small as possible (Assouline & Or, 2013). Based on Franks & Beerling, 2009.</figcaption>

**At low CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, plants with many stomata are at an advantage and therefore prevalent. When there is a lot of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere, plants with fewer stomata are at an advantage and they will be more common** (Thanukos, 2018). This is illustrated in Figure 2.

**Fossil plant material shows that plants respond to long-term changes in CO<sub>2</sub> by adjusting the density of their stomata.** Apart from photosynthesis, transpiration and water management of the plants are also factors that play a role (Franks & Beerling, 2009; de Boer et al., 2016).

**The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere can therefore be derived from stomatal density. Since CO<sub>2</sub> levels have a direct effect on global temperatures, changes in CO<sub>2</sub> levels also provide a clear picture of changes in the climate.** (Assouline & Or, 2013; Franks & Beerling, 2009).

<strong>C<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>, and CAM (optional)</strong><br>

The evolution in the plant kingdom has resulted in three types of plants: C<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>4</sub> and CAM plants. For each type, the photosynthesis process is different. In warm areas, C<sub>3</sub> plants tend to favor respiration at the expense of photosynthesis. C<sub>4</sub> and CAM plants have adapted their photosynthesis processes to counter this.<br>
<ul><li>Approximately 85% of plant species are C<sub>3</sub> plants, such as grains and vegetables (e.g. rice, wheat, spinach, tomatoes) and all trees (e.g. apple trees, oak). They form molecules with 3 carbon atoms during the photosynthesis process.</li></ul><br>
<ul><li>Approximately 5% of plant species are C<sub>4</sub> plants, such as corn, millet, sugarcane, and many grasses. They make up 25% of the plants on earth and are particularly common in tropical, often arid areas. They form molecules with 4 carbon atoms during the photosynthesis process.</li></ul><br>
<ul><li>The remaining 10% of plant species are CAM plants, such as cactus, pineapple, KalanchoÃ«, and sedum. They are especially found in arid areas with high day temperatures and low night temperatures. They also form molecules with 4 carbon atoms during the photosynthesis process, but they differ from C<sub>4</sub> plants because they open their stomata at night to take in CO<sub>2</sub>. This protects them from dehydration. The CO<sub>2</sub> is stored in the plant and made available again during the day when the necessary light energy is present for photosynthesis. (Yamori et al., 2013; Sterrenwacht Armand Pien, 2018).</li></ul>

For the KIKS project, knowledge of C<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>, and CAM plants is optional.
