# Introduction
No one has ever seen stomata with the naked eye, not even the students. Stomata, therefore, remain an abstract concept for them. For the students and teachers alike, it is a delightful experience to observe stomata with a microscope within the framework of the KIKS project. We use a monocular microscope with the students that magnifies 400 times.

The students can also photograph the stomata through the microscope using a smartphone.
The micrographs taken by the students can be fed into the deep neural network of KIKS to have the stomata in the photo counted.

This learning path covers how to recognize monocotyledons and dicotyledons in the photos. The influence of environmental factors on the formation of stomata is elucidated through a practical exercise. What atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, and hence the temperature of the Earth's surface, mean for the stomata, is explained in detail.
