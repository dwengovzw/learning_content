# KIKS and Mathematics

In *machine learning* and *deep learning*, mathematics and principles from statistics are used:<br>
- matrices, indices, dimension of a matrix and properties of matrices;<br>
- operations with matrices and properties of operations with matrices;<br>
- summation sign;<br>
- progress of functions in graphs about CO<sub>2</sub>, glaciers... and metrics of neural networks;<br>
- polynomial functions in regression;<br>
- functions with multiple prescriptions, e.g., ReLU, sign, Heaviside;<br>
- application of logistic function in the sigmoid as an activation function;<br>
- making and interpreting graphs;<br>
- application of counting problems, e.g., byte, number of hyperparameters;<br>
- application of the formula for the area of an ellipse;<br>
- local and global minimum of a function in gradient descent;<br>
- derivatives and chain rule in gradient descent;<br>
- probability (independent probabilities - product rule) in binary cross-entropy;<br>
- properties of logarithms in binary cross-entropy;<br>
- statistics: importance of standardization, mean and standard deviation, Z-score;<br>
- correlation and regression;<br>
- method of least squares;<br>
- examples of a normal and a skewed distribution in the distribution of color intensity in a grayscale image;<br>
- mathematics applied in digital image processing, RGB code;<br>
- convolution operation;<br>
- vectors in the Perceptron.

The KIKS project is an excellent opportunity to engage in mathematics class in an active learning format and with ICT.<br>
Students work with KIKS on ICT skills, mathematical language proficiency, thinking, reasoning and research skills, and problem-solving skills.<br>
