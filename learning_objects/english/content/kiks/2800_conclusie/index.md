# Conclusion
<div class="alert alert-box alert-warning">
<strong>In summary</strong><br>

Plants adapt to changing conditions such as light, season, temperature, water supply, and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Through their stomata, they regulate their water balance and ensure that they absorb CO<sub>2</sub> to grow.<br>
Throughout evolution, plants have found a balance in this. The higher the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, the fewer stomata they have. The greater the stomatal density, the smaller the stomata. Therefore, the density and size of stomata can be used as a tool to reconstruct the prevailing climate in which the plants grew.

It is important to know how quickly plants adapt, for example, to assess how biodiversity and food supply will be affected by an increasing CO<sub>2</sub> content. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate whether the change in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration during the past 100 years has already had a measurable effect on the stomata of plants.

After this chapter, you know what the relationship is between photosynthesis and stomata.<br>
You know what monocotyledons and dicotyledons are.<br>
You know that the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and other environmental factors have an influence on the formation of stomata.
