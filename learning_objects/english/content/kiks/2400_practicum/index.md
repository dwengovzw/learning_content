# Microscopy

No one has ever seen stomata with the naked eye. You can admire stomata with a **microscope**. That's a great experience, because you can also **photograph** stomata through the microscope with a smartphone. For instance, you can use a monocular microscope that magnifies 400 times.<br>
When you look at **living** material through the microscope, you will see beautiful images (see Figure 1). For this, you need to succeed in removing a piece of the very thin cuticle of the leaf. In some plants, this does not work very well, for example, due to the rigidity of the leaf.

You can compensate for this by using the same method as the researchers from the Botanic Garden Meise, namely taking an **imprint** of the leaf with transparent nail polish (Figure 2).

The photos are then not as nicely colored, but greyish (see Figure 3). But all in all, it still produces beautiful images; nature at its best.

By choosing varied plants, you also get a **variation** in the images: monocots and dicots, large and small stomata, stomata of different shapes ...

***Through a laboratory exercise, you can verify the shape and location of stomata in monocots and dicots.***<br>
***Through a laboratory exercise, you can also study the effect of sun and shade. Formulate a research question and a hypothesis here. After the lab, you refer back to the hypothesis.*** <br>
***Through a laboratory exercise, you can also study the effect of the seasons. Formulate a research question and a hypothesis here. After the lab, you refer back to the hypothesis.***
