# KIKS and STEM
In the KIKS project, a crucial role is set aside for the convolutional neural network to count stomata on microscopic images of plant leaves.<br>
This neural network has come about through the collaboration of experts from different disciplines: biology and computer science.<br>
The neural network has accelerated scientific research in the context of climate change. <br>
To understand this scientific research and the neural network, one must call upon even more disciplines, such as mathematics and geography.
