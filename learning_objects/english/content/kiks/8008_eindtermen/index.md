# KIKS and digital competencies, including ICT and computer science

In the KIKS project, students work with numerical data in the context of climate change, with image data in the realm of digital images, with datasets for training a neural network ...<br>
The project also pays attention to the ethical aspects associated with the development or use of AI systems. <br>
Several learning contents of the KIKS project correspond with the final objective of media literacy and computational thinking in the second grade.

Considerable attention is given to the construction and operation of neural networks. In this context, many fundamentals of computer science are addressed.


# Minimum goals Digital competencies second grade - ICT - Purpose throughput and dual purpose

*04.02 The students use targeted standard functionalities of comparable applications to create digital content.* <br>
*Footnote: Taking into account the context in which the minimum goal is addressed.* <br>
*Note: Creating digital content such as in text, numerical, sound, graphic, audio-visual files.*

*04.03 The students use targeted standard functionalities of comparable applications to manage digital content.* <br>
*Note: Managing digital content such as with the aid of data carriers like internal and external storage; with the aid of organizing techniques such as folder structure, thematic ordering.*

# Threshold goals computer science

**Algorithms and programming**<br>
*These specific end goals are valid in the following study directions: Business sciences, Technological sciences*

*07.01.01 The students apply a structured programming language to develop self-designed solutions for concrete problems.* <br>
*Underlying (knowledge) elements: Control structures. Use of software libraries.*

**Package from algorithms and programming** <br>
*These specific end goals are valid in the following study directions: Biotechnological STEM sciences, Construction sciences*

*07.02.01 The students apply a structured programming language to develop self-designed solutions for concrete problems.*<br>
*Underlying (knowledge) elements: Control structures. Use of software libraries.*
