# Stomata height in trees
Researchers from Brazil used linear regression to examine whether there is a relationship between the number of stomata on leaves in the canopy of a tree and the height of the tree. In a first notebook, you will work with their data and apply linear regression yourself. Finally, you can compare your results with those of the scientists.<br><br>
In a subsequent notebook, you determine the regression line using a method from machine learning. There, a distinction is made between training data and test data.
