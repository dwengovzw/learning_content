# Introduction
Scientists from the Botanical Garden Meise and Ghent University are researching **how trees from the tropical rainforest adapt to climate change**. The stomata on their leaves provide information about the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the atmosphere at the time the plants were growing. The researchers **count** the number of stomata on the leaves and **measure** their size. Afterwards, they compare the results from recent material with that from material a hundred years ago.

However, counting and measuring stomata is a very time-consuming activity. To **automate** this, a computer scientist from Ghent University **has trained a neural network**. To train such a network, many examples are needed: photos of stomata and photos of leaves without stomata.
