# Gradient descent
In mathematics, much attention is paid to the derivative of a real function. Derivatives have many applications, for example in economics and physics.

Derivatives are also important for neural networks. They are used to minimize the cost function. One seeks the minimum by adjusting the
weights step by step, based on the derivative at the 'current' point. This method is called _gradient descent_.
