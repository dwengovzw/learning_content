# Microscopy

Nobody has seen stomata with the naked eye. You can admire stomata with a **microscope**. That is a cool experience, because you can also **photograph** the stomata through the microscope with a smartphone. You can, for example, use a monocular microscope that magnifies 400 times.<br> 
When you look at **living** material through the microscope, you can see beautiful images (See Figure 1). However, you need to manage to remove a piece of the extremely thin cuticle of the leaf. With some plants, this isnâ€™t so easy, for example, because of the toughness of the leaf.

You can compensate for this by using the same method as the researchers from the Plantentuin Meise, namely taking an **imprint** of the leaf with transparent nail polish (Figure 2).

The photos are no longer so beautiful in color, but grayish (see Figure 3). But all in all, it still produces beautiful pictures; nature at its best.

By choosing a variety of plants, you also get a **variation** in the images: monocots and dicots, large and small stomata, stomata of different shapes...
