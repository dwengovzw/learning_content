# Practicum - Microscopy of Stomata
***First, formulate a research question and a hypothesis. After the practicum, report back on the hypothesis.*** <br>

<ul><li>Collect fully grown leaves from plants with parallel veins and from plants with non-parallel veins.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Carefully choose the location from where you pick the leaves based on the research you want to conduct.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Try to remove a part of the very thin cuticle with a blade. Place it on a slide with a drop of water and cover with a cover slip.</li></ul>
<ul><li>If it's not possible due to the texture of the leaf, then take a nail polish imprint of the leaf. Apply the imprint onto a slide using tape.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Record the detailed characteristics of the leaves and stomata: plant, season, sun, shade, monocot or dicot, whether you've used the underside or top side of the leaf.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Examine the specimen under the microscope.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Record what you see: many or few stomata, large or small stomata, what shape they have, how they are arranged...</li></ul>
