# Media Literacy

# KIKS and digital competencies - media literacy

In the KIKS project, students engage with numerical data in the context of climate change, with image data in the realm of digital images, with datasets in the context of training a neural network...<br>
The project also pays attention to the ethical aspects associated with developing or using AI systems. <br>
There is significant attention paid to the construction and functioning of neural networks. In this context, a lot of fundamentals of computer science are discussed.

Multiple learning contents from the KIKS project correspond with the final competency of media literacy and computational thinking in the second grade.

# Minimum goal Digital competencies second grade - Media Literacy - Finality for further education and dual finality

*04.05 Students analyze the impact of digital systems on society from the principles of computational thinking.* <br>
*Recollection: The impact of digital systems on society from principles of computational thinking such as algorithms that digital platforms use in selecting and presenting information to users; the collection of personal information from users and using (misusing) it for their own purposes; influencing the choices of users (e.g., personalized offers, personalized advertising); influencing users' worldview/opinion; making decisions about users (e.g., regarding credit applications, job applications, insurance); creating language interaction with the help of artificial intelligence (chatbot); creating art (images, music, poetry, other art forms) using artificial intelligence; medical imaging to report potential abnormalities to doctors based on an initial scan.* <br>
*Principles of computational thinking such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithms.*
