# KIKS and Geography

The theme of climate change offers many opportunities for geography teachers to incorporate certain curriculum objectives within the framework of the KIKS project. Moreover, the project offers many possibilities for students to learn actively and independently and to acquire ICT skills.

The following items from KIKS are linked to the subject of geography:<br>
- the greenhouse effect and the enhanced greenhouse effect;
- the impact of CO2 on the climate;
- the correlation between CO2 and temperature;
- paleoclimatology and the use of climate proxies (e.g. ice cores and stomata on fossil leaves);
- climate changes from the distant past with, for example, the extinction of certain flora and fauna;
- the Little Ice Age with the extension of mountain glaciers, followed by the melting of the mountain glaciers now, the albedo effect;
- systems that influence each other, such as the emission of greenhouse gases by humans, the climate, photosynthesis, plants that affect the global CO<sub>2</sub> cycle, biodiversity, and the global food supply;
- processing with ICT of the data that NOAA, NASA/GIS, and Scripps make available online;
- the realization that scientists from various fields collaborate to create climate models.
