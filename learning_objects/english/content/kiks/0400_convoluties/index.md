# Convolutions and Other Techniques
With convolutions, you can search for different features in an image. For example, you can detect edges, reduce noise in an image, or soften the contrast in an image. Convolutions are applied in so-called convolutional networks. <br>
The first notebook delves deeper into this.

Apart from convolutions, other techniques are also used, such as ReLU and max pooling. <br>The second notebook discusses these.
