# KIKS and biology

In biology, it is mainly the process of photosynthesis that is discussed:
- uptake of CO<sub>2</sub>;<br>
- the role of photosynthesis in the world's CO<sub>2</sub> cycle;<br>
- the adaptation of plants to the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere and the possible impact on biodiversity and food supply;<br>
- the microscopy practical on stomata;<br>
- the adaptation of plants to environmental factors: drought, temperature, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, sun or shade;<br>

But the responsibility of the consumer and the producer of AI systems is also addressed. Here the link can be made to the sustainability of a system.
