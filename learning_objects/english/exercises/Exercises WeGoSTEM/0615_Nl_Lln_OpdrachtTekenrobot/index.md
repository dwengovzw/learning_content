# Programming the Drawing Robot

If you haven't already secretly started, it's finally time to experiment with your drawing robot yourself! Create the basic program and feel free to try out the items below!

Keep a close eye on the time so that you still have enough time to make a nice drawing after testing!

## Assignment 1: Motors

* Build the following program and see what it does.

## Assignment 2: Testing

* Make the drawing robot draw faster.

* Make the drawing robot draw slower.

* Make the drawing robot's motors turn the other way.


## Assignment 3: Extension

* Make one of the motors turn to the right and the other to the left.

* Make one of the motors turn and the other not.

* Experiment with the motors' speeds.

After this exercise you can control the drawing robot. You understand that the resulting drawing depends on the direction of rotation and the speed of the motors.

If anything is still unclear, the video below summarizes everything again.
