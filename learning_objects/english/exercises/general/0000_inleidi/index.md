# DwenguinoBlockly
## Introduction - teacher

DwenguinoBlockly is a programming environment designed for children in the third grade of primary education and the first grade of secondary education. The environment uses a graphical programming language and gives students the opportunity to program a robot.

Within the programming environment, a simulator has been provided to test programs. In the simulator, you can choose from different scenarios, such as a driving robot, a social robot, and a spirograph (drawing robot). 
For those who do not have physical material at their disposal, DwenguinoBlockly can also be used autonomously as a teaching tool. A physical robot is not necessary.

For those who do have physical material at their disposal, the simulator can be used to test a program before trying it out on the physical robot. This avoids the dilemma of not knowing whether the problem is in the program or with the physical robot if something does not work.
