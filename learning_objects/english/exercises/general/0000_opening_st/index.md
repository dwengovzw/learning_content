# DwenguinoBlockly
## Introduction

DwenguinoBlockly is a programming environment for kids like you!

DwenguinoBlockly has two major advantages:

1. It is adapted to your age (third grade of primary school and first grade of secondary school).
2. It is a graphical programming language. Programming is as easy as dragging blocks on the screen.
3. There is a simulator. On the screen, you can already see what the robot will do.

In the next steps of this learning path, you will learn how to work with DwenguinoBlockly.

Good luck!
