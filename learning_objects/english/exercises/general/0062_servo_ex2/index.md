## Servo motor (blue)

EXERCISE 2

Program both hands so that they can move up and down in intervals of 1 second.

Don't be fooled! This is not the same as the previous exercise. Instead of using the pre-programmed function for waving, you now program both hands separately. So you can move both hands independently of each other or choose to keep the hand in a certain position.

***

If you have succeeded in this exercise, you are now able to do a whole lot of other actions! Your robot can shake hands with someone, cover its eyes, etc.
