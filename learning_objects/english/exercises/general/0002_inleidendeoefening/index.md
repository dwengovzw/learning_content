# dwenguinoBlockly
## Your first program
Now that you know where everything is, you can start programming!

* In the *simulator menu*, choose the drawing robot scenario ![alt](embed/scenario_tekenrobot.png "drawing robot scenario").

* In the *toolbox*, go to the category ![alt](embed/cat_dwenguino.png "category Dwenguino") and look for the *'LCD screen' block*: <br><br>![alt](embed/inloef1.png "LCD block")

* Drag this block to the *code area* and snap it into the ‘setup’ section of the *‘setup/loop’ block*: <br><br>![alt](embed/inloef2.png "click LCD")

* You just wrote your first program!

* Run this program with the simulator by clicking ![alt](embed/simmenu_play.png "simulator play") in the *simulator menu*.

* To stop the simulation, click in the *code area* or on ![alt](embed/simmenu_stop.png "simulator stop").

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
After this exercise, you’ll have the basics of how the environment works. You can take blocks from the <em>toolbox</em> and add them to a program in the <em>code area</em>. You know how to run that code in the simulator and you can switch scenarios in that simulator.

Once a program works in the simulator, you can also try it on a real Dwenguino! Below you’ll find a detailed description of how to upload a program from the simulator to the Dwenguino.
