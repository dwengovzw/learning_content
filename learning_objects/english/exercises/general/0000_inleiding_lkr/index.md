# DwenguinoBlockly
## Introduction - teacher

DwenguinoBlockly is a programming environment designed for children in the upper years of primary education and the first years of secondary education. The environment uses a graphical programming language and gives students the opportunity to program a robot. 

Within the programming environment, a simulator is provided to test programs. In the simulator you can choose from different scenarios, such as a driving robot, a social robot, and a spirograph (drawing robot). 
For those who do not have physical materials available, DwenguinoBlockly can therefore also be used autonomously as a teaching tool. A physical robot is not necessary.

For those who do have physical materials available, the simulator can be used to test a program before trying it out on the physical robot. If something then doesn’t work, you avoid the dilemma of not knowing whether the problem is in the program or with the physical robot.
