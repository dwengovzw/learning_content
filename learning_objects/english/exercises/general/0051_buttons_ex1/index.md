## Buttons

EXERCISE 1.1

The program starts. When the NORTH button is pressed, the first LED (LED 0) turns on.

***

EXERCISE 1.2

It is not intended that LED 0 remains on when you release the button. Make sure the LED turns off when you release the button.

***

<div class="alert alert-box alert-success">
To use buttons, you will always need a control structure. Buttons are always used to control something.
