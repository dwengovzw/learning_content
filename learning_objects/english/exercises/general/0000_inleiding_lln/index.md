# DwenguinoBlockly
## Introduction

Dwenguinoblockly is a programming environment for children like you! 

Dwenguinoblockly has two major advantages:

1. It is tailored to your age (third stage of primary education and first stage of secondary education).
2. It is a graphical programming language. Programming is as simple as dragging blocks on the screen.
3. There is a simulator. On the screen you can already see what the robot will do. 

In the next steps of this learning path you will learn to work with dwenguinoBlockly. 

Good luck!
